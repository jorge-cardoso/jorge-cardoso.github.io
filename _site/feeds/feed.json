This status brings the responsibility for public providers to ensure the development of highly reliable platform and services.\n\nNonetheless, a study from Gartner found that 47% of all documented cloud problems were caused by service outages. Their duration ranged between 40 minutes and five days. Another study from Ponemon Institute found that outages on average cost US$ 690,204. To aggravate these results, the increasing use of commodity hardware to build data centers will negatively contribute and will lower the reliability of existing cloud computing platforms.\n\nThus, the development of new strategies, techniques, and methods to evaluate and increase the reliability and resilience of cloud platforms from a software perspective is fundamental.\n\nGoal\nThis workshop intends to bring together industry, academia, and regulators to identify the most relevant requirements in the field of cloud reliability and resilience, on one hand, and existing state-of-the-art solutions, on the other. We invite engineers, scientists, and experts to discuss and contribute to the creation of a new generation of highly reliable cloud platforms.\n\nTopics of Interest\nThe workshop places focus on the following topics:\n\n\n  Challenges of data center reliability\n  Methods and algorithms for failure prediction\n  Damage detection and problem diagnosis\n  Automated repair and recovery of cloud systems\n  Disaster recovery in cloud computing\n  Fault-injection as an approach for reliability\n  Evaluation of cloud platforms reliability\n  Cloud reliability metrics and benchmarks\n  Service Level Agreement (SLA) and reliability\n  Quality of Service in the cloud\n  Standards, regulations, and legislation\n\n\nGeneral Chairs\n\n  Henrik Abramowicz, EIT Digital, Germany.\n  Jorge Cardoso, Huawei ERC, Munich, Germany and University of Coimbra, Portugal\n\n\nSteering Committee\n\n  Dr. Götz Reinhäckel, Head of Cloud Engineering, T-Systems International, Germany.\n  Dr. Jeff Voas, US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), US.\n  Prof. Paulo Esteves Veríssimo, University of Luxembourg, Luxembourg.\n  Michel Drescher, Cloud Computing Standards Specialist, University of Oxford, UK.\n  Valentina Salapura, Chief Architect, Resiliency and Business Continuity, IBM, US.\n\n\nInvited Speakers\n\n  Building Blocks for Site Reliability At Google, Sebastian Kirsch, Google, Switzerland.\n  Breaking Azure for Fun and Profit, Pavel Michailov, Microsoft, US.\n  Using Event-driven Automation and Workflows for Auto-remediation, Dmitri Zimine, Brocade, US.\n  High Availability and Disaster Recovery in OpenStack: From humble beginnings to enterprise reliability, Florian Haas, Hastexo, Austria.\n  A Tale of Ice and Fire, or: The Cloud and The Standards, Michel Drescher, University of Oxford, UK.\n  I’m No Hero: Full Stack Reliability at LinkedIn, Todd Palino, LinkedIn, US.\n  Resilient Cloud Storage – The Consistency View, Neeraj Suri, TU Darmstadt, Germany.\n  A Cloud is Not Enough, Reliable Delivery Matters More, Ajay Gulati, ZeroStack, US.\n  Dependable Storage and Computing using Multiple Cloud Providers, Alysson Neves Bessani, University of Lisbon, Portugal.\n  Cloud Based Fault Injection for Anomaly Detection, Craig Sheridan, flexiOPS, UK.\n\n\nLocation\n\nEIT Digital Berlin Co-Location Centre\n\n",

In 2011, technologies based on Ecore and EMF were used for modeling. To surpass existing limitations (e.g., rigidity and complexity) and to find a better alignment with web standards (e.g., HTTP and URI) motivated researchers develop Linked USDL, an approach based on Linked Data principles.\nIt was completed in 2013 and it is the fourth version of the language.\n\n\n  Jorge Cardoso and Carlos Pedrinaci, Evolution and Overview of Linked USDL. 6th International Conference Exploring Services Science, IESS 2015, Porto, Portugal, February 4-6, 2015, LNBIP, Vol. 201, Novoa, Henriqueta, Dragoicea, Monica (Eds.), 2015.\n\n",

            "title": "Data Science for Non-Programmers",
            "content": "Background\nThe leading consulting company McKinsey estimates that there will be a shortage of data scientists to enable organizations to explore the full potential of big data. By 2018, the United States alone will face a shortage of 140,000 to 190,000 professionals with strong analytical skills with the know-how to analyze big data to make effective decisions. This shortage will be more dramatic in Portugal since, in contrast to US universities that provide Data Science degrees for several years (e.g., at Berkeley and Carnegie Mellon University), Portuguese universities are just making the first steps. In short, without Data Science professionals, the competitive advantage that big data can bring to Portuguese companies will remain untapped.\n\nThe Problem\nThis shortage of professionals cannot be mitigated easily since training students to become data scientists requires time and resources to teach skills from diverse knowledge areas such as Computer Science, Statistics, Business, and Data Visualization. Data scientists are involved across the full data lifecycle – from acquiring new data sets to making business decisions based on the knowledge discovered. They need to be skilled with programming languages (e.g., Python and Perl) to clean, integrate and transform data, and use complex programming packages (e.g., Scikit-Learn for analytics and MatPlotLib for visualization). Mastering this type of working environment is not easy.\n\nObjective\nA short term objective for companies will be to explore the use of visual programming paradigms to enable non-programmers to be part of the Data Science workforce.\n\nExisting Approaches\nIn contrast to existing approaches, which require programming, Scientific Workflow Management Systems (SWMS) can become an alternative to support the visual programming of data science projects. Such systems (e.g. Taverna and Kepler) use a simple graphical, graph-based structure to develop applications. This simplicity has shown to be suitable in several scientific areas such as bioinformatics, geophysics, and climate analysis.\n\nLimitation\nDespite the success of SWMS in data intensive research, they did not reach a state where non-programmers data scientists can use them. They still require some programming and scripting skills to code individual processing tasks. That is why research teams using those systems are usually composed of scientists and software developers. Thus, further research is required to remove any programming still required from these systems to make them suitable for non-programmers.\n\nProposed Approach\nCurrent SWMS need to be extended to support the parameterization of generic prebuild workflow templates. Workflow templates capture the processing tasks of data science projects. A template can be seen as a formalized best practice that data scientists can use to solve common data analysis challenges. Templates are developed by multidisciplinary teams of experts and reused by non-programmer data scientists, since they do not require programming. Parameterized workflows have been used successfully in the field of enterprise computing since 1970 to increase software reuse. For example, SAP became the largest software company in Europe by using parameterized workflows to automatize business process models. We claim that the same type of benefits can be obtained by parameterizing scientific workflow templates.\n\nImplementation\nApproaches based on templates can be implemented in SWMSs such as Taverna, an open source software tool for designing and executing workflows, which is used by 350 major research institutions worldwide. Platforms, such as ?myexperiment.org?, can be used for sharing workflow templates among data scientists.\n\nEvaluation\nNaturally, this systems need to be evaluated by data intensive organizations such as telecommunication providers and governmental agencies managing Open Data. Furthermore, hackathons can be ideal events to attract young participants, interested in developing science, business, and technology projects, to evaluate these new types of approaches.\n\nBenefits\nOn the one hand, workflow templates and SWMSs will be available for student and professionals to conduct data science experiments. On the other hand, such a project can generate a wealth of material – workflow templates, datasets, articles, code, and software – which will be used to prepare new hands-on courses on Data Science and SWMS to be offered at the university level.\n\n",

Fox, Morgan Kaufmann, 2013.Learning OutcomesRecall (knowledge), interpret (comprehension), apply, analyse, create (synthesis), evaluate.      Understand the main concepts, key technologies, benefits, and characteristics of cloud computing.        Identify the architecture associated with cloud computing, including SaaS, PaaS, IaaS, public cloud, private cloud, and hybrid cloud.        Write a research paper and present the results.  Chapter 01 __ IntroductionSummary. The first chapter provides an introduction to the term ‘cloud’. What is the cloud? What is cloud Computing? Where is the cloud? Who is providing clouds? These are all questions you have probably heard and asked yourself. The term ‘cloud’ and ‘cloud computing’ is being used everywhere and often with a fuzzy meaning. Companies are quickly adopting cloud computing since it enables to outsource IT and allows to use the latest technologies without large invertment on infrastructure, software and IT staff. Examples of cloud services include Microsoft OfficeLive, DropBox, AppEngine, SalesForce VMforce, and Amazon EC2.Key points covered. What are cloud services? What is cloud computing? Business shift. Job market. Examples of cloud services.Material.  Lecture 1: Introduction.  Lab 1: Amazon AWS Hands-on.Chapter 02 __ ConceptsSummary. The second chapter covers important concepts which are fundamental to understand why cloud computing became so quickly widespread. One of the major benefits of the cloud comes for the economic model it delivers. Cloud service providers adopt a “pay as you go” or OpEx model which allows customers to pay only for what they use (similar to energy or waterwi). Customers do not need to own expensive assets (e.g., data centers, servers, or software), the CapEx. Naturally, the benefits of the cloud go beyond the economic model provided and also include additional positive aspects such as on-demand self-service, broad network access, and elasticity. Different types of software are made available to customers. While, nowadays, many classifications exist, one of the first taxonomies developed included only three main classes: Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). Each type identifies which software is made available as a utility. For example, storage, hardware, servers, compilers and development environments, or office applications. Finally, cloud platform can be build for private use, these are called private clouds, or for public usage, these are called public clouds. A use of both types is called a hybrid cloud.Key points covered. Computing shift. Economical driver. Definition. Cloud characteristics. Deployment models. Delivery models. Examples.

The dissemination and easy of use of web services and Application Programming Interfaces (API) has enables the edification of an API Economy. Companies can seamlessly work together by integrating their information systems using programming interfaces and provide they as web services. The technologies that made this possible live under the umbrella of distributed systems and correspond to two schools of thought: WS-* Services/SOAP and REST. WS-* Services and SOAP are based on traditional standards (XML, SOAP, HTTP, etc.) and REST where minimal middleware is necessary (only HTTP support is required). These two approaches provide the basic building blocks for cloud computing and are used by most platforms available in the market.Key points covered. The API Economy. Distributed Systems.

Nowadays, there are three public cloud providers in field of IaaS: Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform, and IBM Bluemix. Other players are emerging. Examples include Open Telekom Cloud from Deutsche Telekom,  Telefonica’s Open Cloud, Alibaba, BT, NTT, Orange, Rackspace, Salesforce, etc. Amazon AWS is the leader by innovation and market share. Nonetheless, analysts believe that Microsoft Azure will soon overtake AWS. The AWS platform was launched in 2006. In 2016, it is composed of 35 Availability Zones (AZ) within 13 geographic Regions (e.g., Ireland, Frankfurt, Sao Paulo, Singapore, Tokyo, Sydney, Northern Virginia, Oregon). It has a rich spectrum of services from compute, storage, netowrking, analytics, mobile, developer tools, management tools, and security spaces. To programatically manage complex set ups in the AWS, several tools and and SDK libaries exist. For example, boto can be used to automate AWS services in Python. It allows to write scripts to provide programmatic connectivity to Amazon Web Services.Key points covered. Cloud Computing Offerings.

Cloud computing does not only provides a service-based access to virtual machines, more interestingly, it enables to create so called cloud-native applications. Applications that can be developed on a cloud platform, use the many resources available, run at scale with a high reliability, and avoid problems such as the Slashdot Effect. This requires new cloud architectures that depart from traditional enterprise application design to address requirements such as high availability, scalability, and elasticity. For example, IBM Cloud Architecture Center enables developers to understand how to quickly create new cloud native applications using Bluemix, IBM’s PaaS solution. The types of services provided by a cloud platform enable to develop architectures, e.g., with four tiers, which not easily engineered using traditional software platforms. Thus, architectures are evolving into Multitier architectures. Amazon AWS provides an infrastructure which contains the necessary ingredients to develop distributed system with high availability, scalability, and elasticity. Examples of key services include multiple zones, cloudwatch, auto-scaling, elastic load balancers, and message queues. To facilitate the development of native applications, companies and academia is looking into ways to identify and abstract generic architectures which can be reused across domains. Initiatives centered in patterns have been popular. Examples include, Microsoft Cloud Design Patterns, AWS Cloud Design Patterns, and the book Cloud Computing Patterns coming from the academia. Dependability, and in particular reliability, have gained importance since planet-scale cloud application need often to be available 24x7x52. Since native applications can be seen as complex systems with services, behavior, compositions, which are put together using an architectural style driven by decisions, existing concepts and theories from the field of software engineering can be used to evaluate the reliability of theories.Key points covered.

            "content": "In planet-scale deployments, the Operation and Maintenance (O&M) of cloud platforms cannot be done any longer manually or simply with off-the-shelf solutions. It requires self-developed automated systems, ideally exploiting the use of AI to provide tools for autonomous cloud operations. We rely on deep learning, distributed traces, and time-series analysis (sequence analysis) to effectively detect and fix anomalous cloud infrastructure behaviors during operations to reduce the workload of human operators. The iForesight system is being used to evaluate new O&M approaches. iForesight 3.0 is the result of 2 years of research with the goal to provide an intelligent new tool aimed at SRE cloud maintenance teams. It enables them to quickly detect and predict anomalies thanks to the use of artificial intelligence when cloud services are slow or unresponsive. ## Our GoalThe **Intelligent Cloud Operations** team of Huawei Cloud is based in [Munich](https://www.muenchen.de/int/en.html), Germany. We are part of the SRE organization. Huawei Cloud is one of the largest and fastest growing platforms in the world. It has a strong presence throughout the world with over 40 availability zones located across 23 geographical regions,ranging from Hong Kong and Russia to Thailand and South Africa.Our mission is to analyze observability data from [Huawei Cloud](https://www.huaweicloud.com/en-us/about/about_us.html)to detect impact to customers, identify the root cause within seconds, and fix the problem using the 1/5/10 rule (detection: 1 min, RCA: 5 min, recovery: 10 min).## Next-gen SolutionsOur cloud has planet-scale technical requirements with an [microservices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices) architecture composed of hundreds of services.They are distributed over thousands of hosts in many geographical regions and operate with an availability higher than [five nines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_availability). Our system monitors Huawei Cloud which is build on top of [OpenStack](https://docs.openstack.org/), an opensource cloud operating system. OpenStack controls large pools of compute, storage, and networkingresources throughout tens of datacenters. The base services are predominantly written in Python and Java running on Linux. In 2017 we adopted AI in the form of [Data Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science) and [Machine Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning) approaches for anomaly detection, root-cause analysis, fault prediction, and automated recovery into our suite. These techniques, including **statistics**, **time-series analysis**, **deep learning**, **big data**,**streaming**, and **data visualization**, enabled us to develop new production-ready services for troubleshooting Huawei Cloud and detect issues which were previously undetectable.For example, we can autonomously identify anomalous microservices' latencies by dynamically choosingtemporal features, predict memory leaks ahead of time before impacting systems, or finding rare message entries in service logs with billions records. We applies all these techniques to real-time data streams.With the success of anomaly detection in 2017-2018, in 2019 we are planning the next phase of our next-gen monitoring and troubleshooting suite. We will extend anomaly detection by implementing two new detector services for distributed trace and service logs.All the anomaly detectors contribute with results to a central knowledge repository of metric, trace, and log observations, and alarms and relevant external events (e.g., platform upgrades).A [semi-supervised machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-supervised_learning) system will analyzethe repository to automatically identify complex incidents associated with failures and explain the underlyingpossible root-cause to SREs and operators. This analysis will learn associations between anomalies, alerts and external events which will be formalized as rules and stored in a [knowledge-based system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge-based_systems).On top, a smart assistant will help operators in making associations and decisions on the relationship between alerts and anomalies for [root-cause analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_cause_analysis).

            "title": "Cloud Reliability and Resilience",
            "content": "## OverviewReliability is a measure of the percentage uptime of cloud services to customers, considering the downtime due to faults. Many cloud providers are setting a reliability level of 99.95% ([download uptime cheat sheet](http://royal.pingdom.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/pingdom_uptime_cheat_sheet.pdf)). This means that if you provision a VM it will be available 99.95% of the time, with a possible downtime of 21.6 minutes per month. Reliability is an important characteristic which enables platforms to adapt and recover under stress and remain functional from a customer perspective. You can find additional information from a Meetup meeting on [Cloud Reliability and Resilience](http://www.slideshare.net/JorgeCardoso4/cloud-resilience-with-open-stack).Every year big companies made the headlines for the wrong reason: reliability problems. In Q1 2016, Microsoft (9 days), Twitter (8h), Apple (7h), are PayPal (7h) are the \"lucky\" winners:+ Two separate outages meant [Microsoft's biggest customers haven't had access to email](http://www.businessinsider.de/microsoft-has-a-9-day-long-office-365-outage-2016-1?r=UK&IR=T) for several days.+ [Twitter Went Down](http://recode.net/2016/01/19/twitter-went-down-because-of-an-internal-code-change/) Because of an ‘Internal Code Change’.+ eBay, Etsy and Online Merchants Hit by [PayPal Outage](http://www.ecommercebytes.com/C/blog/blog.pl?/pl/2016/3/1457113386.html)+ [Apple Pay suffers](http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/2446737/apple-pay-suffers-first-wobble-with-seven-hour-outage) first wobble with seven-hour outage. Problem saw Visa users unable to sign up to iPhone payments service.According to section of [IEEE Society](http://rs.ieee.org) working on Reliability, \"reliability engineering is a design engineering discipline which applies scientific knowledge to assure that a system will perform its intended function for the required duration within a given environment, including the ability to test and support the system through its total lifecycle (...) it is the probability of failure-free software operation for a specified period of time in a specified environment.\"Cloud resiliency is the ability of a cloud platform or service to recover and continue operating when failures occur. Automated means for recovery are the most desirable solutions.### Open Positions+ MSc thesis.

[Junior/Senior Researcher Large-scale Distributed Systems](http://jorge-cardoso.github.io/research/JD_IT_Junior_Senior_Researcher_Large-Scale_Distributed_Systems_(Jul 2016).pdf)## OpenStack Cloud OSOpenStack is a cloud operating system (Cloud OS) for building public and private clouds. It can control pools of compute, storage, and networking recourses located in large data centres. It is supported by major IT players in the world which include IBM, HP, Intel, Huawei, Red Hat, AT&T, and Ericsson. At Huawei Research we are currently developing the next generation of reliable cloud platforms for Deutsche Telekom. The Open Telekom Cloud engineered by Huawei and operated by T-Systems was launched at CeBIT 2016 and delivers flexible and convenient cloud services.Major players are building competences in the field of cloud reliability. [Microsoft Trustworthy Computing](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/twc/reliability.aspx) has a division dedicated to Reliability and IBM offers specialized [Resiliency Services](http://www-935.ibm.com/services/us/en/it-services/business-continuity/) to assure continuous business operations and improve overall reliability.Cloud reliability and resilience of OpenStack can be analyzed and improved at 3 levels:+ Level 1. OpenStack paltform and services+ Level 2. Hypervisor and virtual machines (VM) managed+ Level 3. Applications running inside VMsWe concentrate our efforts on Level 1.## General Problems with Building Large-scale Distributed SystemsReliable large-scale distributed systems are hard to build since their validation is time consuming, complex, and often non-deterministic. OpenStack is not an exception. Research from Microsoft with [MODIST](https://www.usenix.org/legacy/event/nsdi09/tech/full_papers/yang/yang_html/) (Junfeng Yang, et al., MODIST: Transparent Model Checking of Unmodified Distributed Systems Proceedings of the 6th Symposium on Networked Systems Design and Implementation (NSDI '09), Pages 213-228) exemplifies well the problems associated with general distributed systems. Experiments found a total of 35 bugs in Berkeley DB, a Paxos implementation, and a primary-backup replication protocol implementation. Thus, validation, testing, and benchmarking frameworks are needed, specifically, when OpenStack is used to support mission critical applications.Building large-scale distributed systems requires the consideration of several theories, technologies, and methodologies, such as:+ [CAP Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAP_theorem)+ [Microservices](http://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html)+ [Twelve Factor App](https://12factor.net)## Available Approaches (Industry solutions, Patents, Research Papers)### Fault Injection+ [Fault-injection technologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fault_injection) or FIT provides approaches to demonstrate that software is robustness and fault tolerance by injecting faults to damage internal components to test its fault tolerance.+ Domenico Cotroneo and Henrique Madeira.

Intrumentation is done between openStack and the hypervisor, the database, REST, HTTP, and AMQP. Server-crash faults are injected by killing relevant service processes via systemd.+ (Graph-based) In [HANSEL: Diagnosing Faults in OpenStack](http://conferences2.sigcomm.org/co-next/2015/img/papers/conext15-final156.pdf]), the auhtors intercept AMQP and REST messages to reconstruct an execution graph. The approach requires network monitoring agents at each node in the OpenStack deployment. One of the challenges is the so-called transaction stitching to reconstruct full transactions to recreate the execution graph.+ (String-based) In [Toward achieving operational excellence in a cloud](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6798708&url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fxpls%2Fabs_all.jsp%3Farnumber%3D6798708) and [US20150161025 A1: Injecting Faults at Select Execution Points of Distributed Applications ](http://www.google.com/patents/US20150161025), the authors rely on the operating system level information to build message traces by observing system events such as SEND or RECV system calls (or LIBC calls). These events are monitored per thread since with higher granularities (i.e., process-level or system-level), the job of separating events is difficult. Message sequences are converted into string of symbols and strings are comapred using an edit distance function. High distances indicate possible anomalies between executions.+ [DICE Fault Injection](https://github.com/dice-project/DICE-Fault-Injection-Tool): A tool to generate faults within Virtual Machine.

When a failure occurs, the path is marked as problematic.+ Generic approaches for reliability such as Fault Tree Analysis (FTA), Root cause analysis (RCA), Failure mode and effects analysis (FMCA), Cause–effect graphs, Ishikawa diagram, Five whys, etc.### TracingTraditional monitoring solutions for cloud platforms and applications, such as [Cloudwatch](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/) from Amazon AWS, [Ceilometer](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Telemetry) from Openstack, and [Nagios](https://www.nagios.org/), place emphasis on *component-based monitoring*. Existing solutions collect detailed information on system statistics about virtual machines, CPU, disk IO, hosts, RPC, etc.Component-based monitoring tools provide not information into the relationship between the components of a distributed service. Since debugging a distributed system is a danting task using these tools, cross-component monitoring (tracing) solutions were explored to aliviate exisitng limitation by tracing the path of events and method calls that are generated at runtime.The study from Sambasivan, Raja R., et al. titled [So, you want to trace your distributed system? Key design insights from years of practical experience](http://www.pdl.cmu.edu/PDL-FTP/SelfStar/CMU-PDL-14-102.pdf) (Vol. 102. Technical Report, CMU-PDL-14, 2014) provides a very good overview of tracing systems developed up to 2014, and include the analysis of X-Trace, Magpie, Dapper, etc. The thesis from Nathan Scott of the Monash University, Australia, titled [Unifying Event Trace and Sampled Performance Data] (http://pcp.io/papers/unifying-thesis.pdf) also give a fairly good overview of these main tracing systems.+ [X-Trace](http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~istoica/papers/2007/xtr-nsdi07.pdf) from [Berkeley](http://www.berkeley.edu/) outputs a set of task graphs according to Lamport’s happens before relation to trace the execution path of a distributed system. It does not rely on physical clocks and uses low level primitives for instrumentation (e.g., xtr::logEvent(string), xtr::logEvent(\"end\"), pushdown(), and pushnext()).+ [Magpie](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/magpie/) from [Microsoft](http://www.microsoft.com) infers traces by combining event logs generated by low level black-box instrumentation. It automatically extracting individual requests from a running system and constructs a probabilistic workload model. Magpie relies on experts with deep knowledge about the system to construct a schema of how to correlate events in different components. In contrast to other approach (from Google, Twitter, and Cloudera), it infers causal relations from the events generated by the operating system and application instrumentation.+ [Dapper](http://research.google.com/pubs/pub36356.html) from [Google](http://www.google.com) focuses on library and middleware modifications and provides a special context to track execution across async callbacks and RPCs.+ [HTrace](https://github.com/cloudera/htrace) from [Cloudera](www.cloudera.com/) is a tracing framework intended for use with distributed systems written in java. It is similar to Dapper and performs end-to-end tracing to capture detailed paths of causally between events generated by the components which make a distributed system.+ [Zipkin](http://zipkin.io) from Twitter is also a distributed tracing system. It helps gather timing data needed to troubleshoot latency problems in microservice architectures.

It does so by validating any cloud implementation against the OpenStack Tempest API testsOther tools from the field of APM ([Application Performance Management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_performance_management)), such as [NewRelic](https://newrelic.com) limite their span to monitor the performance of transactions across web application stacks.### Repair and RecoveryAutomation is having an important role in making the management of cloud data centers automated and 'automatic'. The principals underlying Google SRE and DevOps all call for automation. For cloud reliability and resilience, the procedures to repair the IT infrastructure need to be encoded into executable processes. Large-scale distributed monitoring (dapper), stream and events (spark and flink), and time-based databases (prometheus) provide the base to identify important event that when flagged as alarms need to trigger encoded procedures to repair faulty systems. An important question is 'How to encode procedures to repair IT infrastructure automatically?'## Huawei's ApproachEnsuring the reliability of large-scale, complex distributed cloud platform requires new innovative approaches. While NetFlix’s ChaosMonkey proposed a new tool (and concept) for site reliability engineers, it only enables the analysis of cloud native applications. Since at Huawei we are developing highly reliable cloud platforms (e.g., Openstack), the site reliability engineering team developed a new approach framework, called Butterfly Effect, to automatically inject faults into cloud infrastructures.+ Efficient execution trace processing using stream processing+ Dynamic time-based fingerprinting to detect timeouts+ Position and negative fingerprints for automated diagnosis and localization of user commands+ Rely as much possible on open source and Python (see [Python frameworks, libraries, software and resources](https://github.com/vinta/awesome-python))## Research Groups and Initiatives+ [Reliable Software Systems (RSS) Group](http://www.iste.uni-stuttgart.de/rss.html), Institute for Software Technology (ISTE)University of Stuttgart, Germany.+ [Resilient Computing Lab (RCL)](http://rcl.dsi.unifi.it), University of Florence, Italy.+ [Software and Systems Engineering](https://www.cisuc.uc.pt/groups/show/sse), University of Coimbra, Portugal.+ [Dependable Cloud Operations](http://ssrg.nicta.com.au/projects/cloud), Software Systems Research/NICTA, Australia.+ [InIT Cloud Computing Lab (ICCLab)](http://blog.zhaw.ch/icclab/), Zurich, Switzerland.+ [ICT COST Action IC1304](http://www.cost.eu/COST_Actions/ict/Actions/IC1304).

            "content": "Past Projects------------------------------###Semantic Domain SystemEnterprises have the need to communicate. In business to business applications, usually XML is used to automatically exchange information. But sometimes more semantics is needed. Enterprises  also need to share concepts, terms, definitions and relationships (between concepts) relevant to their business activities.Why are developing the Semantic Domain System which is a systems that follows similar concepts from the DNS.The Domain Name System or DNS, is a service where relationships between IP addresses and physical domains are stored.When you request your browser, email client, ftp client or any other application to search for a specific domain,it automatically calls the DNS Server and finds the IP for the machine that offers the required service. It enablesthe use of names instead of IP addresses. Each company is responsible for maintaining their own IP addresses.In SDS, like in DNS, each company is responsible for managing their own concepts and is able to browse other companies'concept definitions. The system will allow a clear representation of concepts and relationships between concepts.###Semantic B2B IntegrationB2B integration, also known as external IS integration and e-business integration, has promised to automate andintegrate business processes and interactions between companies by considerably renovating the way business wasconducted with partners, suppliers, and customers. B2B integration is fundamentally about data and informationexchange among businesses and their information systems. The ability to interact and exchange information bothinternally and with external organizations (partners, suppliers, customers) is a fundamental issue in the enterprise sector.One simple solution that organizations have adopted to reach a higher level of integration relied on the use of XML as thelanguage to represent data. XML has become a de facto standard of B2B because of its simplicity, extensibility and ease ofprocessing. Today its estimated that most organizations use XML to store and transfer data. This is the reason why we createdB2BISS (Business-to-Business Integration using Syntactic-to-Semantic Mapping).### JXML2OWLToday's enterprises face critical needs in integrating disparate information spread over several data sources insideand even outside the organization. Semantic web technologies, such as ontologies, play an important role in the semanticintegration of data. The purpose of JXMLOWL is to present a framework to assist the semantic data integration process.The framework supports mappings and instances transformation from syntactic data sources in XML format to a commonglobal model defined by an ontology using semantic web related technologies such as OWL.### Business Process Quality MetricsOur intentions are twofold. On the one hand, we think it is fundamental to survey findings from neighboring disciplines onhow Business Process Quality Metrics can be developed. In particular, we believe that we can gather additional insights fromsoftware engineering, cognitive science, and graph theory and relate them to business process modeling. A further empiricalinvestigation might ultimately lead to establishing a complexity theory of business process models. On the other hand, we plan todemonstrate that these metrics serves their purpose, we plan to carry out several empirical validations by means of controlled experiments.### Other projects+ Process Control-Flow Analysis+ Semantic Dynamic Packaging (POSI/EIA/56164/2004).+ DME&nbsp;Web Site Development, Jos&eacute; Nelson Alves e Duarte Abreu.+ Poseidon: A tool for semi-automatic process design, Jose Miguel Rodrigues de Freitas and Luis Roberto Fernandes Faria.+ Web Services over Peer-to-Peer infrastructure, Martinho da Silva Correia.+ Quality of Service Management for METEOR Workflow Management System, University of Georgia, GA, USA.+ Semantic e-Workflow Composition for METEOR Workflow Management System, University of Georgia, GA, USA.+ MARATHON Workflow Management System, Jorge Cardoso and Christoph Bussler, Boeing Company, July 1999, WA, USA.+ SketchPad, CCG/ZGDV - Centro de Computa&ccedil;&atilde;o Gr&aacute;fica and IGD/Darmstadt, Germany+ DiagLactato 2.0: An Expert System for Healthcare, 1994.+ CUCo - Comunicar Utilizando o Computador, Projecto Minerva, Universidade de Coimbra, 1994.+ Puzzle Quiz, Projecto Minerva, Universidade de Coimbra, 1992.+ Task Game, Projecto Minerva, Universidade de Coimbra, 1991.",

We analyse large logs from IT service provisioning (e.g., ITIL) to find human behaviour patterns which are rewarded or penalized. Interesting work. It is the new challenge for companies, the future so to say: to analyse people behaviour... My new upcoming book on Service Systems  Fundamentals/Springer will have a chapter dedicated to the topic.### Service DescriptionsLinked USDL (Unified Service Description Language) enables describing business, software, or real-world services using computer-readable and computer-understandable specifications to make them tradable on the web/Internet. It uses RDFS to provide a shared model. Check Github and linked-usdl.orgBellow is an earlier video explaining the goal of USDL (please note that since then, XML has been replaced by RDFS).### Service SystemsThe Linked Service System model for the Unified Service Description Language (LSS-USDL) explores the development of lightweight semantic models to capture the essence of service systems. Real service systems can be modeled with LSS-USDL, they can be accessed and queried programmatically, and they can be annotated with background knowledge. Check Github and this recent book Service Systems.The graphical artifact used to create interactions for service systems using the LSS USDL model:This approach provides descriptions that can be used for service management, optimization, and analytics.+ Jorge Cardoso, Ricardo Lopes, and Geert Poels.

Service revenues from companies, such as Rolls Royce, Caterpillar, and ThyssenKrupp, often reach more than 35\\% of total sales. In the field of information technology, the global spending on cloud services is expected to grow 40\\% over the next seven years. Despite these facts, services are still the least studied part of the economy.The observation that the power of service-based economies is no longer restricted to individual organizations, but spans across networks, is the main driver for conducting service network research. Networks play an important role in many application areas such as energy grid distribution and smart city planning. Service networks are a class of networks of emerging interest since worldwide economies are becoming increasingly connected. Nonetheless, while the economies of many countries are becoming service-oriented, very few studies on service networks exist.Understanding when, why, where, and how service networks function best is fundamental for the future because their analysis can provide an ``x-ray'' of service-based economies.",
