Springer 2014.\n\n\nThis SpringerBrief explores the internal workings of service systems. \n\nThe authors propose a lightweight semantic model for an effective representation to capture the essence of service systems. Key topics include modeling frameworks, service descriptions and linked data, creating service instances, tool support, and applications in enterprises. Previous books on service system modeling and various streams of scientific developments used an external perspective to describe how systems can be integrated. This brief introduces the concept of white-box service system modeling as an approach to model the internal aspects and elements of service systems. This approach provides descriptions that can be used for service management, optimization, and analytics. \n\nService Systems: Concepts, Modeling, and Programming is designed for researchers, teachers, and advanced-level students who want to learn about the new emerging field of service science and IS/IT practitioners who are looking for better ways to describe, model, and communicate services.\n\nThis book is available at Springer.com\n",

By defining, analyzing, and redesigning an organizationâ€™s resources and operations, workflow management systems ensure that the right information reaches the right person or computer application at the right time. The book provides a basic overview of workflow terminology and organization, as well as detailed coverage of workflow modeling with Petri nets. Because Petri nets make definitions easier to understand for nonexperts, they facilitate communication between designers and users.

IGI Global 2009.\n\n\nIn the last 10 years, there has been an explosion in the number of theories, technologies, standards, and tools providing business process support. At the same time, process support has taken an increasingly important role within information systems development (process-aware systems). \n\nThe conjunction of these factors has created a need among practitioners (e.g., researchers, system analysts, IT consultants, business analysts, and chief process officers) for a book providing a broad overview of this promising field from an academic and industrial perspective. \n\nTo achieve this goal, this handbook will bring together in one place contributions from leading experts, thereby guaranteeing a broad and diverse base of knowledge and expertise. The need for a comprehensive and authoritative book on Research on Business Process Modeling is latent among researchers from academia and industry and from workflow and BPM vendors. Stakeholders are often overloaded with a massive amount of BPM data available on the Web, but with no coherent 360? view of the field. When referring to general theory, techniques, and technologies, publications refer to an array of survey articles, with no reference standing out as an agreed-upon source of common ground.\n\nThis book is available at igi-global.com\n",

IGI Global 2008.\n\n\nThe main objective of the book is to lay the foundations for understanding the technologies behind the Semantic Web. \n\nOrganizations are striving for literature that guides them in the development of end-to-end applications and systems that use semantics. While the industry is willing to use semantics, the academia has not yet shown how to systematically employ Semantic Web technologies to deploy a new breed of systems. \n\nThe book aims to provide relevant theories, tools, and methodologies to develop semantic applications. It is written for students and professionals who want to improve their understanding of how semantics and ontologies can be used inside organizations. It also aims at studying the application of semantics to each of the steps in the semantic applications lifecycle and how semantics can help address critical issues in reuse, integration, and interoperability.\n\nThis book is available at amazon.com\n",

Springer 2008.\n\n\nSemantic Web: Real-World Applications from Industry offers a glimpse into the opening door of semantic technologies by means of concentrated examples of semantic applications in real business environments. \n\nFor quite a while, there has been evidence from academic research and early industrial prototypes that semantic technology can help humans and machines substantially in accessing and using the unprecedented, and exponentially growing, amount of information that the World Wide Web provides. Now semantic technology is moving from academic and industrial research into real products and applications.  This book provides a series of case studies which demonstrate how real benefits can be derived from the adoption of semantic technology in popular business domains, such as telecommunication, B2B integration, healthcare, education, and others.\n\nSemantic Web: Real-World Applications from Industry summarizes state-of-the art expertise and practical experiences from outstanding technology showcases. This volume was written as a joint effort of leading experts in the field of semantic technology from various backgrounds and countries, including industry, academia, and government agencies. It combines a detailed description of the challenges and technical solutions with a discussion of the actual results and a wealth of lessons learned, which will be invaluable for future investments into semantic technology.\n\nSemantic Web: Real-World Applications from Industry was designed for industry professionals and researchers interested in the current state and future of semantic technology. This book is also suitable as a secondary advanced-level text or reference for students in computer science.\n\nForeword by Michael L.

            "content": "Research topics for PhD/MSc-----------------You would like to do research? Maybe your MSc or PhD? You love to discover new things? To propose new innovative ideas? You like the areas of Service Science, Business Process Management, Information Systems, and Semantic Web?                  Then you should send me an e-mail (jcardoso hhatte dei.uc.pt) and/or we should have a chat (office D2.20). I always have a couple of interesting topics to be explored.Research Streams---------------Our recent research places emphasis on three fields: service description languages (with the USDL family), service system modeling (with the LSS USDL language), and service networks (using principals from social networks).####Service Descriptions Linked USDL (Unified Service Description Language) was developed for describing business, software, or real-world services using computer-readable and computer-understandable specifications to make them tradable on the web/Internet. Linked USDL takes the form of a reference schema which is an approach used in many fields to facilitate the exchange of data and integration of information systems. For example, online social networks rely on FOAF to describe people and relationships; computer systems use WSDL to describe distributed software-based services; GoodRelations is used to mainly describe products; and business-to-business systems use ebXML to describe transactions, orders, and invoices. Adding to these existing standards, Linked USDL describes services in a comprehensive way by providing a business or commercial description around (real-world) services.Therefore, Linked USDL is seen has one of the foundational technologies for setting up emerging infrastructures for the Future Internet, web service ecosystems, and the Internet of Services. ####Service SystemsThis field explores the development of lightweight semantic models to capture the essence of service systems. The field includes key topics such as modeling frameworks, service descriptions and linked data, creating service instances, tool support, and applications in enterprises. We have proposed a service system model called Linked Service System model for the Unified Service Description Language (LSS-USDL). Real service systems can be modeled with LSS-USDL using semantic web languages, they can be accessed and queried programmatically, and they can be annotated with background knowledge.This approach provides descriptions that can be used for service management, optimization, and analytics.####Service Networks Societies are becoming increasingly service-oriented. Service revenues from companies, such as Rolls Royce, Caterpillar, and ThyssenKrupp, often reach more than 35\\% of total sales. In the field of information technology, the global spending on cloud services is expected to grow 40\\% over the next seven years. Despite these facts, services are still the least studied part of the economy.The observation that the power of service-based economies is no longer restricted to individual organizations, but spans across networks, is the main driver for conducting service network research. Networks play an important role in many application areas such as energy grid distribution and smart city planning. Service networks are a class of networks of emerging interest since worldwide economies are becoming increasingly connected. Nonetheless, while the economies of many countries are becoming service-oriented, very few studies on service networks exist. Understanding when, why, where, and how service networks function best is fundamental for the future because their analysis can provide an ``x-ray'' of service-based economies.Current Projects-----------------+ Linked USDL.

In business to business applications, usually XML is used to automatically exchange information. But sometimes more semantics is needed. Enterprises  also need to share concepts, terms, definitions and relationships (between concepts) relevant to their business activities.Why are developing the Semantic Domain System which is a systems that follows similar concepts from the DNS. The Domain Name System or DNS, is a service where relationships between IP addresses and physical domains are stored. When you request your browser, email client, ftp client or any other application to search for a specific domain, it automatically calls the DNS Server and finds the IP for the machine that offers the required service. It enables the use of names instead of IP addresses. Each company is responsible for maintaining their own IP addresses.In SDS, like in DNS, each company is responsible for managing their own concepts and is able to browse other companies'concept definitions. The system will allow a clear representation of concepts and relationships between concepts.\t  ###Semantic B2B IntegrationB2B integration, also known as external IS integration and e-business integration, has promised to automate and integrate business processes and interactions between companies by considerably renovating the way business was conducted with partners, suppliers, and customers. B2B integration is fundamentally about data and information exchange among businesses and their information systems. The ability to interact and exchange information both internally and with external organizations (partners, suppliers, customers) is a fundamental issue in the enterprise sector.One simple solution that organizations have adopted to reach a higher level of integration relied on the use of XML as thelanguage to represent data. XML has become a de facto standard of B2B because of its simplicity, extensibility and ease ofprocessing. Today its estimated that most organizations use XML to store and transfer data. This is the reason why we created B2BISS (Business-to-Business Integration using Syntactic-to-Semantic Mapping)\t  ### JXML2OWL Today's enterprises face critical needs in integrating disparate information spread over several data sources inside and even outside the organization. Semantic web technologies, such as ontologies, play an important role in the semantic integration of data. The purpose of JXMLOWL is to present a framework to assist the semantic data integration process. The framework supports mappings and instances transformation from syntactic data sources in XML format to a common  global model defined by an ontology using semantic web related technologies such as OWL- ### Business Process Quality MetricsOur intentions are twofold. On the one hand, we think it is fundamental to survey findings from neighboring disciplines on how Business Process Quality Metrics can be developed. In particular, we believe that we can gather additional insights from software engineering, cognitive science, and graph theory and relate them to business process modeling. A further empirical investigation might ultimately lead to establishing a complexity theory of business process models. On the other hand, we plan to demonstrate that these metrics serves their purpose, we plan to carry out several empirical validations by means of controlled experiments.### Other projects+ Process Control-Flow Analysis (http://apus.uma.pt/~jcardoso/ComplexityAnalysis/index.php)+ Semantic Dynamic Packaging (POSI/EIA/56164/2004).+ DME&nbsp;Web Site Development, Jos&eacute; Nelson Alves e Duarte Abreu.+ Poseidon: A tool for semi-automatic process design,Jos&eacute; Miguel Rodrigues de Freitas and Luis Roberto Fernandes Faria.+ Web Services over Peer-to-Peer infrastructure, Martinho da Silva Correia.+ Quality of Service Management for METEOR Workflow Management System, University of Georgia, GA, USA.+ Semantic e-Workflow Composition for METEOR Workflow Management System, University of Georgia, GA, USA.+ MARATHON - Workflow Management System, Jorge Cardoso and Christoph Bussler, Boeing Company, July 1999, WA, USA.+ SketchPad, CCG/ZGDV - Centro de Computa&ccedil;&atilde;o Gr&aacute;fica and IGD/Darmstadt, Germany+ DiagLactato 2.0 (in Portuguese) - An Expert System for Healthcare, Septembre 1994.+ CUCo - Comunicar Utilizando o Computador, Projecto Minerva, Universidade de Coimbra, 1994.+ Puzzle Quiz, Projecto Minerva, Universidade de Coimbra, 1992.+T ask Game, Projecto Minerva, Universidade de Coimbra, 1991.Past Students-----------------+ Coimbra+ KIT+ SAP+ Madeira\t",
