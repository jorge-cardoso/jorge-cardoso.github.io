				<h2 id="research-topics-for-phdmsc">Research topics for PhD/MSc</h2>
<p>You would like to do research? Maybe your MSc or PhD? You love to discover new things? To propose new innovative ideas? You like the areas of Service Science, Business Process Management, Information Systems, and Semantic Web?</p>

<p>Then you should send me an e-mail (jcardoso hhatte dei.uc.pt) and/or we should have a chat (office D2.20). I always have a couple of interesting topics to be explored.</p>

<h2 id="research-streams">Research Streams</h2>

<p>Our recent research places emphasis on three fields: service description languages (with the USDL family), service system modeling (with the LSS USDL language), and service networks (using principals from social networks).</p>

<h4 id="service-descriptions">Service Descriptions</h4>
<p>Linked USDL (Unified Service Description Language) was developed for describing business, software, or real-world services using computer-readable and computer-understandable specifications to make them tradable on the web/Internet. </p>
<p>
Linked USDL takes the form of a reference schema which is an approach used in many fields to facilitate the exchange of data and integration of information systems. 
<a href="https://github.com/linked-usdl">
<img src="/images/Logo-linked-usdl.png" height="128" width="128" style="float:left;margin:10px 20px 0 0;" />
</a>
For example, online social networks rely on FOAF to describe people and relationships; computer systems use WSDL to describe distributed software-based services; GoodRelations is used to mainly describe products; and business-to-business systems use ebXML to describe transactions, orders, and invoices. Adding to these existing standards, Linked USDL describes services in a comprehensive way by providing a business or commercial description around (real-world) services.
</p>
<p>Therefore, Linked USDL is seen has one of the foundational technologies for setting up emerging infrastructures for the Future Internet, web service ecosystems, and the Internet of Services. </p>

<h4 id="service-systems">Service Systems</h4>
<p>This field explores the development of lightweight semantic models to capture the essence of service systems. The field includes key topics such as modeling frameworks, service descriptions and linked data, creating service instances, tool support, and applications in enterprises. </p>

<p>
<a href="https://github.com/jorge-cardoso/lss-usdl">
<img src="/images/Logo-LSS-USDL.png" width="200" style="float:left;margin:0 20px 0 0;" />
</a>
We have proposed a service system model called Linked Service System model for the Unified Service Description Language (LSS-USDL). Real service systems can be modeled with LSS-USDL using semantic web languages, they can be accessed and queried programmatically, and they can be annotated with background knowledge.
</p>

<p>This approach provides descriptions that can be used for service management, optimization, and analytics.</p>

<h4 id="service-networks">Service Networks</h4>

<p>Societies are becoming increasingly service-oriented. Service revenues from companies, such as Rolls Royce, Caterpillar, and ThyssenKrupp, often reach more than 35\% of total sales. In the field of information technology, the global spending on cloud services is expected to grow 40\% over the next seven years. Despite these facts, services are still the least studied part of the economy.</p>

<p>
<a href="https://github.com/linked-usdl">
<img src="/images/Logo-Service-Network.png" height="128" width="155" style="float:left;margin:0 20px 0 0;" />
</a>
The observation that the power of service-based economies is no longer restricted to individual organizations, but spans across networks, is the main driver for conducting service network research. Networks play an important role in many application areas such as energy grid distribution and smart city planning. Service networks are a class of networks of emerging interest since worldwide economies are becoming increasingly connected. Nonetheless, while the economies of many countries are becoming service-oriented, very few studies on service networks exist. 
</p>

<p>Understanding when, why, where, and how service networks function best is fundamental for the future because their analysis can provide an ``x-ray’’ of service-based economies.</p>

<h3 id="semantic-domain-system">Semantic Domain System</h3>
<p><a href="sds/">
<img src="/images/sds.gif" width="100" style="float:left;margin:0 20px 0 0;" />
</a>
Enterprises have the need to communicate. In business to business applications, usually XML is used to automatically exchange information. But sometimes more semantics is needed. Enterprises  also need to share concepts, terms, definitions and relationships (between concepts) relevant to their business activities.
</p>

<p>Why are developing the Semantic Domain System which is a systems that follows similar concepts from the DNS. 
The Domain Name System or DNS, is a service where relationships between IP addresses and physical domains are stored. 
When you request your browser, email client, ftp client or any other application to search for a specific domain, 
it automatically calls the DNS Server and finds the IP for the machine that offers the required service. It enables 
the use of names instead of IP addresses. Each company is responsible for maintaining their own IP addresses.</p>

<p>In SDS, like in DNS, each company is responsible for managing their own concepts and is able to browse other companies'
concept definitions. The system will allow a clear representation of concepts and relationships between concepts.</p>

<h3 id="semantic-b2b-integration">Semantic B2B Integration</h3>
<p><a href="B2BISS/">
<img src="/images/b2biss_vertical_small.png" width="100" style="float:left;margin:0 20px 0 0;" />
</a>
B2B integration, also known as external IS integration and e-business integration, has promised to automate and 
integrate business processes and interactions between companies by considerably renovating the way business was 
conducted with partners, suppliers, and customers. B2B integration is fundamentally about data and information 
exchange among businesses and their information systems. The ability to interact and exchange information both 
internally and with external organizations (partners, suppliers, customers) is a fundamental issue in the enterprise sector.
</p>

<p>One simple solution that organizations have adopted to reach a higher level of integration relied on the use of XML as the
language to represent data. XML has become a de facto standard of B2B because of its simplicity, extensibility and ease of
processing. Today its estimated that most organizations use XML to store and transfer data. This is the reason why we created 
B2BISS (Business-to-Business Integration using Syntactic-to-Semantic Mapping)</p>

<h3 id="jxml2owl">JXML2OWL</h3>
<p><a href="jxml2owl/index.html">
<img src="/images/JXML2OWL.gif" width="100" style="float:left;margin:0 20px 0 0;" />
</a>
Today's enterprises face critical needs in integrating disparate information spread over several data sources inside 
and even outside the organization. Semantic web technologies, such as ontologies, play an important role in the semantic 
integration of data. The purpose of JXMLOWL is to present a framework to assist the semantic data integration process. 
The framework supports mappings and instances transformation from syntactic data sources in XML format to a common 
 global model defined by an ontology using semantic web related technologies such as OWL-
 </p>

<h3 id="business-process-quality-metrics">Business Process Quality Metrics</h3>
<p><a href="BPQM/bpqm.html">
<img src="/images/bpqm.jpg" width="100" style="float:left;margin:0 20px 0 0;" />
</a>
Our intentions are twofold. On the one hand, we think it is fundamental to survey findings from neighboring disciplines on 
how Business Process Quality Metrics can be developed. In particular, we believe that we can gather additional insights from 
software engineering, cognitive science, and graph theory and relate them to business process modeling. A further empirical 
investigation might ultimately lead to establishing a complexity theory of business process models. On the other hand, we plan to 
demonstrate that these metrics serves their purpose, we plan to carry out several empirical validations by means of controlled experiments.
