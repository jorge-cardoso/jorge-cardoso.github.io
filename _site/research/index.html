				<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Reliability is a measure of the percentage uptime of cloud services to customers, considering the downtime due to faults. Many cloud providers are setting a reliability level of 99.95% (<a href="http://royal.pingdom.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/pingdom_uptime_cheat_sheet.pdf">download uptime cheat sheet</a>). This means that if you provision a VM it will be available 99.95% of the time, with a possible downtime of 21.6 minutes per month. Reliability is an important characteristic which enables platforms to adapt and recover under stress and remain functional from a customer perspective. You can find additional information from a Meetup meeting on <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/JorgeCardoso4/cloud-resilience-with-open-stack">Cloud Reliability and Resilience</a>.</p>

<p>Every year big companies made the headlines for the wrong reason: reliability problems. In Q1 2016, Microsoft (9 days), Twitter (8h), Apple (7h), are PayPal (7h) are the “lucky” winners:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Two separate outages meant <a href="http://www.businessinsider.de/microsoft-has-a-9-day-long-office-365-outage-2016-1?r=UK&amp;IR=T">Microsoft’s biggest customers haven’t had access to email</a> for several days.</li>
  <li><a href="http://recode.net/2016/01/19/twitter-went-down-because-of-an-internal-code-change/">Twitter Went Down</a> Because of an ‘Internal Code Change’.</li>
  <li>eBay, Etsy and Online Merchants Hit by <a href="http://www.ecommercebytes.com/C/blog/blog.pl?/pl/2016/3/1457113386.html">PayPal Outage</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/2446737/apple-pay-suffers-first-wobble-with-seven-hour-outage">Apple Pay suffers</a> first wobble with seven-hour outage. Problem saw Visa users unable to sign up to iPhone payments service.</li>
</ul>

<p>According to section of <a href="http://rs.ieee.org">IEEE Society</a> working on Reliability, “reliability engineering is a design engineering discipline which applies scientific knowledge to assure that a system will perform its intended function for the required duration within a given environment, including the ability to test and support the system through its total lifecycle (…) it is the probability of failure-free software operation for a specified period of time in a specified environment.”</p>

<p>Cloud resiliency is the ability of a cloud platform or service to recover and continue operating when failures occur. Automated means for recovery are the most desirable solutions.</p>

<h2 id="openstack-cloud-os">OpenStack Cloud OS</h2>
<p>OpenStack is a cloud operating system (Cloud OS) for building public and private clouds. It can control pools of compute, storage, and networking recourses located in large data centres. It is supported by major IT players in the world which include IBM, HP, Intel, Huawei, Red Hat, AT&amp;T, and Ericsson. At Huawei Research we are currently developing the next generation of reliable cloud platforms for Deutsche Telekom. The Open Telekom Cloud engineered by Huawei and operated by T-Systems was launched at CeBIT 2016 and delivers flexible and convenient cloud services.</p>

<p><img align="right" src="/images/OTC.png" width="450" /></p>

<p>Major players are building competences in the field of cloud reliability. <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/twc/reliability.aspx">Microsoft Trustworthy Computing</a> has a division dedicated to Reliability and IBM offers specialized <a href="http://www-935.ibm.com/services/us/en/it-services/business-continuity/">Resiliency Services</a> to assure continuous business operations and improve overall reliability.</p>

<p>Cloud reliability and resilience of OpenStack can be analyzed and improved at 3 levels:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Level 1. OpenStack paltform and services</li>
  <li>Level 2. Hypervisor and virtual machines (VM) managed</li>
  <li>Level 3. Applications running inside VMs</li>
</ul>

<p>We concentrate our efforts on Level 1.</p>

<h2 id="general-problems-with-building-large-scale-distributed-systems">General Problems with Building Large-scale Distributed Systems</h2>

<p>Reliable large-scale distributed systems are hard to build since their validation is time consuming, complex, and often non-deterministic. OpenStack is not an exception. Research from Microsoft with <a href="https://www.usenix.org/legacy/event/nsdi09/tech/full_papers/yang/yang_html/">MODIST</a> (Junfeng Yang, et al., MODIST: Transparent Model Checking of Unmodified Distributed Systems Proceedings of the 6th Symposium on Networked Systems Design and Implementation (NSDI ‘09), Pages 213-228) exemplifies well the problems associated with general distributed systems. Experiments found a total of 35 bugs in Berkeley DB, a Paxos implementation, and a primary-backup replication protocol implementation. Thus, validation, testing, and benchmarking frameworks are needed, specifically, when OpenStack is used to support mission critical applications.</p>

<p>Building large-scale distributed systems requires the consideration of several theories, technologies, and methodologies, such as:</p>

These events are monitored per thread since with higher granularities (i.e., process-level or system-level), the job of separating events is difficult. Message sequences are converted into string of symbols and strings are comapred using an edit distance function. High distances indicate possible anomalies between executions.</li>

<h3 id="tracing">Tracing</h3>

<p>Traditional monitoring solutions for cloud platforms and applications, such as <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/">Cloudwatch</a> from Amazon AWS, <a href="https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Telemetry">Ceilometer</a> from Openstack, and <a href="https://www.nagios.org/">Nagios</a>, place emphasis on <em>component-based monitoring</em>. Existing solutions collect detailed information on system statistics about virtual machines, CPU, disk IO, hosts, RPC, etc.</p>

<p>Component-based monitoring tools provide not information into the relationship between the components of a distributed service. Since debugging a distributed system is a danting task using these tools, cross-component monitoring (tracing) solutions were explored to aliviate exisitng limitation by tracing the path of events and method calls that are generated at runtime.</p>

<p>The study from Sambasivan, Raja R., et al. titled <a href="http://www.pdl.cmu.edu/PDL-FTP/SelfStar/CMU-PDL-14-102.pdf">So, you want to trace your distributed system? Key design insights from years of practical experience</a> (Vol. 102. Technical Report, CMU-PDL-14, 2014) provides a very good overview of tracing systems developed up to 2014, and include the analysis of X-Trace, Magpie, Dapper, etc. The thesis from Nathan Scott of the Monash University, Australia, titled [Unifying Event Trace and Sampled Performance Data] (http://pcp.io/papers/unifying-thesis.pdf) also give a fairly good overview of these main tracing systems.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~istoica/papers/2007/xtr-nsdi07.pdf">X-Trace</a> from <a href="http://www.berkeley.edu/">Berkeley</a> outputs a set of task graphs according to Lamport’s happens before relation to trace the execution path of a distributed system. It does not rely on physical clocks and uses low level primitives for instrumentation (e.g., xtr::logEvent(string), xtr::logEvent(“end”), pushdown(), and pushnext()).</li>
  <li><a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/magpie/">Magpie</a> from <a href="http://www.microsoft.com">Microsoft</a> infers traces by combining event logs generated by low level black-box instrumentation. It automatically extracting individual requests from a running system and constructs a probabilistic workload model. Magpie relies on experts with deep knowledge about the system to construct a schema of how to correlate events in different components. In contrast to other approach (from Google, Twitter, and Cloudera), it infers causal relations from the events generated by the operating system and application instrumentation.</li>
  <li><a href="http://research.google.com/pubs/pub36356.html">Dapper</a> from <a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a> focuses on library and middleware modifications and provides a special context to track execution across async callbacks and RPCs.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/cloudera/htrace">HTrace</a> from <a href="www.cloudera.com/">Cloudera</a> is a tracing framework intended for use with distributed systems written in java. It is similar to Dapper and performs end-to-end tracing to capture detailed paths of causally between events generated by the components which make a distributed system.</li>
  <li><a href="http://zipkin.io">Zipkin</a> from Twitter is also a distributed tracing system. It helps gather timing data needed to troubleshoot latency problems in microservice architectures. Zipkin’s design is based on the Google Dapper.</li>

<h3 id="repair-and-recovery">Repair and Recovery</h3>
<p>Automation is having an important role in making the management of cloud data centers automated and ‘automatic’. The principals underlying Google SRE and DevOps all call for automation. For cloud reliability and resilience, the procedures to repair the IT infrastructure need to be encoded into executable processes. Large-scale distributed monitoring (dapper), stream and events (spark and flink), and time-based databases (prometheus) provide the base to identify important event that when flagged as alarms need to trigger encoded procedures to repair faulty systems. An important question is ‘How to encode procedures to repair IT infrastructure automatically?’</p>

<h2 id="huaweis-approach">Huawei’s Approach</h2>

<p>Ensuring the reliability of large-scale, complex distributed cloud platform requires new innovative approaches. While NetFlix’s ChaosMonkey proposed a new tool (and concept) for site reliability engineers, it only enables the analysis of cloud native applications. Since at Huawei we are developing highly reliable cloud platforms (e.g., Openstack), the site reliability engineering team developed a new approach framework, called Butterfly Effect, to automatically inject faults into cloud infrastructures.</p>
