	Abstract = {The Internet of services introduces new requirements for service engineering
	in terms of addressing both business and technical perspectives.
	The inherent complexity of the new wave of services that is emerging
	requires new approaches for an effective and efficient service design.
	In this chapter a novel service engineering framework is introduced:
	the Integrated Service Engineering (ISE) framework. With its ISE
	workbench, it can address the emerging requirements of Internet of
	services. The chapter presents the foundations on how the service
	engineering process can be conducted by applying the separation of
	concerns to model different service dimensions within various layers
	of abstraction. Additionally, three novel extensions are presented
	to the aforementioned ISE workbench in order to enrich the capabilities
	of the service modeling process.},

	Abstract = {The article discusses the state of ongoing efforts to implement Semantic
	Web (Web 3.0), as indicated by a survey conducted among several hundred
	Semantic Web academics and practitioners. Protege continues to be
	the most popular ontology editor, with Swoop a distant second. OWL
	and RDF Schema are the two most popular ontology languages. Education,
	computer software, and government were the top three areas for which
	survey participants developed ontologies. On-To-Knowledge was the
	most popular methodology used for developing ontologies among those
	who use a methodology, although 60% of respondents don't use one.},

	are being conducted in isolation. The objective of this paper is
	to investigate to which extend two promising specifications, USDL
	and TOSCA, can be integrated to automate the lifecycle of cloud applications.
	In our approach, we selected a commercial SaaS CRM platform, modeled
	it using the service description language USDL, modeled its cloud
	deployment using TOSCA, and constructed a prototypical platform to
	integrate service selection with deployment. Our evaluation indicates
	that a high level of integration is possible. We were able to fully
	automatize the remote deployment of a cloud service after it was
	selected by a customer in a marketplace. Architectural decisions
	emerged during the construction of the platform and were related
	to global service identification and access, multi-layer routing,
	and dynamic binding.},

@article{Cardoso04ERP,
	Abstract = {Two important classes of information systems, Workflow Management
	Systems (WfMSs) and Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems, have
	been used to support e-business process redesign, integration, and
	management. While both technologies can help with business process
	automation, data transfer, and information sharing, the technological
	approach and features of solutions provided by WfMS and ERP are different.
	Currently, there is a lack of understanding of these two classes
	of information systems in the industry and academia, thus hindering
	their effective applications. In this paper, we present a comprehensive
	comparison between these two classes of systems. We discuss how the
	two types of systems can be used independently or together to develop
	intra- and inter-organizational application solutions. In particular,
	we also explore the roles of WfMS and ERP in the next generation
	of IT architecture based on Web Services. Our findings should help
	businesses make better decisions in the adoption of both WfMS and
	ERP in their e-business strategies. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

@article{Cardoso2011B2BIntegration,
	Abstract = {XML-based standards have been widely used to enable and ease Business-to-Business
	(B2B) integration. Examples of standards include cXML, CIDX and ebXML.
	While these XML-based standards are syntactic, contemporary organizations
	have available new means to structure their internal data representations
	using semantic descriptions, such as RDF(S) and OWL. This scenario
	poses an interesting challenge: "How to reconcile external XML-based
	standards and internal OWL-based representations in B2B integration
	scenarios?" In this paper, we present a conceptual approach, and
	its implementation, to integrate external syntactic data representations
	with organizational internal semantic data representations by using
	the notion of heterogeneous mappings which are established between
	the two types of representations.},

@inproceedings{Cardoso2012Self-service,
	Abstract = {Many worldwide economies have moved away from manufacturing and became
	service-oriented. As a consequence, research on Internet-based Self-Services
	(ISS) will foster the uptake of service exports and trading since
	they can replace many face-to-face interactions and make service
	transactions more accurate, convenient and faster. Currently, ISS
	are poorly supported since they are created using generic software
	techniques and development methods. Systematic methods are needed
	and must go beyond service design, a well established research area,
	to account also for service analysis, implementation, and deployment.
	In this paper, we explore a systematic development approach, called
	SEASIDE, based on four scientific advances: enterprise architectures
	(EA), model-driven developments (MDD), model-view-controller pattern
	(MVC), and platform as a service (PaaS). By selecting the Incident
	Management service from the Information Technology Infrastructure
	Library, we have evaluated our approach. Our research indicates that
	the proposed method enables to focus on the business and design side
	of services, and reduce development time and costs.},

	Abstract = {This article provides the foundations for the new field of research
	coined Service Networks research. Understanding what factors explain
	the structure and dynamics of global service networks may lead to
	a more efficient and balanced society and economy. The concept of
	service network is formally represented as a business structure made
	up of services systems which are nodes connected by one or more specific
	types of relationships. They can be used to represent the global
	economy, i.e. a complex network composed of national economies, which
	are themselves networks of markets, and markets are also networks
	of providers, brokers, intermediaries, and consumers. The authors'
	key challenge consists in developing a novel perspective on socio-economic
	dynamics by connecting service models representing service systems
	(e.g. consulting, governmental, and educational services). Theories
	to be developed will enable to understand, describe, explain, analyze,
	predict, and control the evolution of global service networks.},

	the provision of specialized multi-party services through automation
	and standardization. Current research, such as the *-USDL service
	description language family, is already defining the basic building
	blocks to model the next generation of business services. Nonetheless,
	the developments being made do not target to interconnect services
	via service relationships. Without the concept of relationship, marketplaces
	will be seen as mere functional silos containing service descriptions.
	Yet, in real economies, all services are related and connected. Therefore,
	to address this gap we introduce the concept of open semantic service
	network (OSSN), concerned with the establishment of rich relationships
	between services. These networks will provide valuable knowledge
	on the global service economy, which can be exploited for many socio-economic
	and scientific purposes such as service network analysis, management,
	and control.},

	Abstract = {The Internet of Services (IoS) embraces new business and technological
	models that can radically change the way day-to-day services are
	provisioned and contracted. Within the IoS, services which were traditionally
	not created based on an established science and operated without
	a systematic approach, will be digitalized using proper methodologies,
	standards, and tools. The digital specification of services will
	enable their trading over the Internet using electronic marketplaces.
	This paper provides four main contributions to the IoS research:
	a definition and characterization for the concept of IoS-based service,
	the role and importance of platform services for the IoS, the challenges
	of managing SLA dependencies between IoS-based services in compositions,
	and a model-based approach for service engineering that can be used
	to design IoS-based services.},

@inproceedings{Cardoso2013ServiceSystemAnalytics,
	Abstract = {Services become every day more important for society. Cost prediction
	is one important aspect which has not received the required attention.
	Nonetheless, its impact on the economic success of service-based
	industries is considerable and, so, it cannot be overlooked. Therefore,
	in this paper we tackle the problem of cost prediction of service
	systems. Since previous work generally followed an ad hoc approach,
	we present a three layered approach based on customer factors to
	measure customer involvement since it is a good predictor for service
	cost. Service co-creation between customer and provider is the central
	concept of our costing approach. For service modelling we use Linked
	USDL, and to reason on costing data we use methods from service analytics.
	On the one hand, we reduce the uncertainty introduced by customers
	and can predict more accurate service costs. On the other hand, the
	systematic approach enables a better understanding of the costing
	problem and the service systems under study, and increases reusability
	of service analytics algorithms.},

@article{Terziyan2011PRIME,
	Abstract = {Enabling interoperability between a large number of heterogeneous
	entities (devices, software, humans, abstractions, etc.), while ensuring
	predictability and safety of their operation, is difficult without
	an extra layer of intelligence that will ensure the orchestration
	of these various actors according to well-defined goals, taking into
	account changing constraints, business objectives or regulations.
	This chapter introduces such a layer. Our extensions to the semantic
	technologies will provide cross-layer communication services (data-level
	interoperability) to the entities on the Internet of Things, and
	extended multi-agent technologies will provide collaboration-support
	services (functional protocol-level interoperability and coordination)
	for these entities. We present the PRIME inter-middleware as an intended
	extension of the recently designed UBIWARE platform, which connects
	heterogeneous, both industrial and non-industrial, resources belonging
	to different layers of the Internet of Things. We consider the three
	layers of physical devices, software, and humans interconnected through
	the Middleware-as-a-Service platforms that are normally used for
	connecting relatively homogeneous resources at the respective individual
	layers.},
