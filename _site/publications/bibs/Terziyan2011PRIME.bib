This chapter introduces such a layer. Our extensions to the semantic	technologies will provide cross-layer communication services (data-level	interoperability) to the entities on the Internet of Things, and	extended multi-agent technologies will provide collaboration-support	services (functional protocol-level interoperability and coordination)	for these entities. We present the PRIME inter-middleware as an intended	extension of the recently designed UBIWARE platform, which connects	heterogeneous, both industrial and non-industrial, resources belonging	to different layers of the Internet of Things. We consider the three	layers of physical devices, software, and humans interconnected through	the Middleware-as-a-Service platforms that are normally used for	connecting relatively homogeneous resources at the respective individual	layers.},  owner = {jcardoso},  timestamp = {2011.07.14},  webpdf = {/Papers/JA-2011-018-EEJET-PRIME-middleware.pdf}}
