@inproceedings{Cardoso2013ServiceSystemAnalytics,	Abstract = {Services become every day more important for society. Cost prediction	is one important aspect which has not received the required attention.	Nonetheless, its impact on the economic success of service-based	industries is considerable and, so, it cannot be overlooked. Therefore,	in this paper we tackle the problem of cost prediction of service	systems. Since previous work generally followed an ad hoc approach,	we present a three layered approach based on customer factors to	measure customer involvement since it is a good predictor for service	cost. Service co-creation between customer and provider is the central	concept of our costing approach. For service modelling we use Linked	USDL, and to reason on costing data we use methods from service analytics.	On the one hand, we reduce the uncertainty introduced by customers	and can predict more accurate service costs. On the other hand, the	systematic approach enables a better understanding of the costing	problem and the service systems under study, and increases reusability	of service analytics algorithms.},	Author = {Wolfgang Seiringer and Jorge Cardoso and Johannes Kunze von Bischhoffshausen},	Booktitle = {14th IFIP Working Conference on Virtual Enterprises (PRO-VE'13), Dresden, Germany, 30 Sep-2 Oct 2013.},	Date-Added = {2018-04-25 20:02:07 +0000},	Date-Modified = {2018-04-25 20:02:07 +0000},	Owner = {jcardoso},	Publisher = {Springer},	Timestamp = {2013.09.02},	Title = {Service System Analytics: Cost Prediction},	Year = {2013}}
