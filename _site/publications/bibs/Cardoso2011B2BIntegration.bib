Examples of standards include cXML, CIDX and ebXML.	While these XML-based standards are syntactic, contemporary organizations	have available new means to structure their internal data representations	using semantic descriptions, such as RDF(S) and OWL. This scenario	poses an interesting challenge: "How to reconcile external XML-based	standards and internal OWL-based representations in B2B integration	scenarios?" In this paper, we present a conceptual approach, and	its implementation, to integrate external syntactic data representations	with organizational internal semantic data representations by using	the notion of heterogeneous mappings which are established between	the two types of representations.},  acmid = {2305007},  address = {Amsterdam, The Netherlands, The Netherlands},  doi = {10.1016/j.datak.2011.07.005},  issn = {0169-023X},  issue_date = {December, 2011},  keywords = {Integration, OWL, Ontology, Schema, XML},  numpages = {24},  publisher = {Elsevier Science Publishers B.
