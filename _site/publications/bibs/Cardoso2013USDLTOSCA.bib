@inproceedings{Cardoso2013USDLTOSCA,	Abstract = {Standardization efforts to simplify the management of cloud applications	are being conducted in isolation. The objective of this paper is	to investigate to which extend two promising specifications, USDL	and TOSCA, can be integrated to automate the lifecycle of cloud applications.	In our approach, we selected a commercial SaaS CRM platform, modeled	it using the service description language USDL, modeled its cloud	deployment using TOSCA, and constructed a prototypical platform to	integrate service selection with deployment. Our evaluation indicates	that a high level of integration is possible. We were able to fully	automatize the remote deployment of a cloud service after it was	selected by a customer in a marketplace. Architectural decisions	emerged during the construction of the platform and were related	to global service identification and access, multi-layer routing,	and dynamic binding.},	Author = {Jorge Cardoso and Tobias Binz and Uwe Breitenb{\"u}cher and Oliver Kopp and Frank Leymann},	Booktitle = {25th Conference on Advanced Information Systems Engineering (CAiSE 2013)},	Date-Added = {2018-04-25 20:02:07 +0000},	Date-Modified = {2018-04-25 20:02:07 +0000},	Pages = {1--16},	Publisher = {Springer},	Series = {LNCS},	Title = {Cloud Computing Automation: Integrating USDL and TOSCA},	Volume = {7908},	Webpdf = {/Papers/CP-2013-068-CAISE-USDL-and-TOSCA.pdf},	Year = {2013}}
