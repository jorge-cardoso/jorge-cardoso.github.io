@inbook{Cardoso10IoSPlatSLAmodel,	Abstract = {The Internet of Services (IoS) embraces new business and technological	models that can radically change the way day-to-day services are	provisioned and contracted. Within the IoS, services which were traditionally	not created based on an established science and operated without	a systematic approach, will be digitalized using proper methodologies,	standards, and tools. The digital specification of services will	enable their trading over the Internet using electronic marketplaces.	This paper provides four main contributions to the IoS research:	a definition and characterization for the concept of IoS-based service,	the role and importance of platform services for the IoS, the challenges	of managing SLA dependencies between IoS-based services in compositions,	and a model-based approach for service engineering that can be used	to design IoS-based services.},	Author = {Cardoso, Jorge and Winkler, Matthias and Voigt, Konrad and Berthold, Henrike},	Booktitle = {Software and Data Technologies},	Date-Added = {2018-04-25 20:02:07 +0000},	Date-Modified = {2018-04-25 20:02:07 +0000},	Editor = {Cordeiro, Jos{\'e} and Ranchordas, AlpeshKumar and Shishkov, Boris},	Isbn = {978-3-642-20116-5},	Owner = {Jorge Cardoso},	Pages = {3-17},	Publisher = {Springer Berlin Heidelberg},	Refid = {211},	Series = {Communications in Computer and Information Science},	Timestamp = {2010.08.26},	Title = {IoS-Based Services, Platform Services, SLA and Models for the Internet of Services},	Url = {http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-20116-5_1},	Volume = {50},	Webpdf = {/Papers/BC-2009-029-Springer-CCIS-Selec-Papers-ICSOFT09-IoS.pdf},	Year = {2011},	Bdsk-Url-1 = {http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-20116-5_1}}
