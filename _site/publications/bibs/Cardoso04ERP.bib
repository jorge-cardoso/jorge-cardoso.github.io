While both technologies can help with business process	automation, data transfer, and information sharing, the technological	approach and features of solutions provided by WfMS and ERP are different.	Currently, there is a lack of understanding of these two classes	of information systems in the industry and academia, thus hindering	their effective applications. In this paper, we present a comprehensive	comparison between these two classes of systems. We discuss how the	two types of systems can be used independently or together to develop	intra- and inter-organizational application solutions. In particular,	we also explore the roles of WfMS and ERP in the next generation	of IT architecture based on Web Services. Our findings should help	businesses make better decisions in the adoption of both WfMS and	ERP in their e-business strategies.
