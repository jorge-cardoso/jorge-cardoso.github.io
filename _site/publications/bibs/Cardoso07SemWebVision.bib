@article{Cardoso07SemWebVision,	Abstract = {The article discusses the state of ongoing efforts to implement Semantic	Web (Web 3.0), as indicated by a survey conducted among several hundred	Semantic Web academics and practitioners. Protege continues to be	the most popular ontology editor, with Swoop a distant second. OWL	and RDF Schema are the two most popular ontology languages. Education,	computer software, and government were the top three areas for which	survey participants developed ontologies. On-To-Knowledge was the	most popular methodology used for developing ontologies among those	who use a methodology, although 60% of respondents don't use one.},	Address = {jcardoso@uma.pt Professor, University of Madeira},	Author = {Cardoso, Jorge},	Date-Added = {2018-04-25 20:02:07 +0000},	Date-Modified = {2018-04-25 20:02:07 +0000},	Issn = {15411672},	Journal = {IEEE Intelligent Systems},	Number = {5},	Owner = {Jorge Cardoso},	Pages = {84-88},	Refid = {174},	Timestamp = {2010.08.26},	Title = {The Semantic Web Vision: Where Are We?},	Url = {http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5552580},	Volume = {22},	Webpdf = {/Papers/JA-2007-013-IEEE-IS-sw-survey.pdf},	Year = {2007},	Bdsk-Url-1 = {http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5552580}}
