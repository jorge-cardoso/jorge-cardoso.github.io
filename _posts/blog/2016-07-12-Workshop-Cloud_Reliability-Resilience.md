#### International Industry-Academia Workshop on Cloud Reliability and Resilience 

November 7-8, Berlin, Germany 

#### Overview
With the increasing adoption and reliance on cloud platforms and services, it is undeniable that cloud computing is becoming a utility such as water, energy, transportation, or telecommunications. This status brings the responsibility for public providers to ensure the development of highly reliable platform and services. 

Nonetheless, a study from Gartner found that 47% of all documented cloud problems were caused by service outages. Their duration ranged between 40 minutes and five days. Another study from Ponemon Institute found that outages on average cost US$ 690,204. To aggravate these results, the increasing use of commodity hardware to build data centers will negatively contribute and will lower the reliability of existing cloud computing platforms.

Thus, the development of new strategies, techniques, and methods to evaluate and increase the reliability and resilience of cloud platforms from a software perspective is fundamental.
This workshop intends to bring together industry, academia, and regulators to identify the most relevant requirements in the field of cloud reliability and resilience, on one hand, and existing state-of-the-art solutions, on the other. We invite engineers, scientists, and experts to discuss and contribute to the creation of a new generation of highly reliable cloud platforms. 

#### Topics of Interest
The workshop places focus on the following topics:
+	Challenges of data center reliability 
+	Methods and algorithms for failure prediction
+	Damage detection and problem diagnosis
+	Automated repair and recovery of cloud systems
+	Disaster recovery in cloud computing 
+	Fault-injection as an approach for reliability
+	Evaluation of cloud platforms reliability 
+	Cloud reliability metrics and benchmarks
+	Service Level Agreement (SLA) and reliability
+	Quality of Service in the cloud
+	Standards, regulations, and legislation
