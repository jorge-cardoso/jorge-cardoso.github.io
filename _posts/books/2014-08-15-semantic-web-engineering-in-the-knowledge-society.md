The main objective of the book is to lay the foundations for understanding the technologies behind the Semantic Web. 

Organizations are striving for literature that guides them in the development of end-to-end applications and systems that use semantics. While the industry is willing to use semantics, the academia has not yet shown how to systematically employ Semantic Web technologies to deploy a new breed of systems. 

The book aims to provide relevant theories, tools, and methodologies to develop semantic applications. It is written for students and professionals who want to improve their understanding of how semantics and ontologies can be used inside organizations. It also aims at studying the application of semantics to each of the steps in the semantic applications lifecycle and how semantics can help address critical issues in reuse, integration, and interoperability.
