Chapter 01 __ Introduction
--------------------------

The first chapter provides an introduction to the term 'cloud'. What is the cloud? What is [cloud Computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing)? Where is the cloud? Who is providing clouds? These are all questions you have probably heard and asked yourself. The term 'cloud' and 'cloud computing' is being used everywhere and often with a fuzzy meaning. Companies are quickly adopting cloud computing since it enables to outsource IT and allows to use the latest technologies without large invertment on infrastructure, software and IT staff. Examples of cloud services include Microsoft OfficeLive, DropBox, AppEngine, SalesForce VMforce, and Amazon EC2.

Chapter 02 __ Concepts
----------------------

This chapter covers important concepts which are fundamental to understand why cloud computing became so quickly widespread. One of the major benefits of the cloud comes for the economic model it delivers. Cloud service providers adopt a "pay as you go" or [OpEx model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_expense) which allows customers to pay only for what they use (similar to energy or waterwi). Customers do not need to own expensive assets (e.g., data centers, servers, or software), the [CapEx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_expenditure). Naturally, the benefits of the cloud go beyond the economic model provided and also include additional positive aspects such as on-demand self-service, broad network access, and elasticity. Different types of software are made available to customers. While, nowadays, many classifications exist, one of the first taxonomies developed included only three main classes: 
[Software as a Service (SaaS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service), [Platform as a Service (PaaS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_as_a_service), and [Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing#Infrastructure_as_a_service_.28IaaS.29). Each type identifies which software is made available as a utility. For example, storage, hardware, servers, compilers and development environments, or office applications. Finally, cloud platform can be build for private use, these are called private clouds, or for public usage, these are called public clouds. A use of both types is called a hybrid cloud.

Chapter 03 __ Web APIs
----------------------

The dissemination and easy of use of web services and [Application Programming Interfaces (API)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface) has enables the edification of an API Economy. Companies can seamlessly work together by integrating their information systems using programming interfaces and provide they as web services. The technologies that made this possible live under the umbrella of distributed systems and correspond to two schools of thought: [WS-\* Services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_web_service_specifications)/[SOAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP) and [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer). WS-\* Services and SOAP are based on traditional standards (XML, SOAP, HTTP, etc.) and REST where minimal [middleware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middleware) is necessary (only HTTP support is required). These two approaches provide the basic building blocks for cloud computing and are used by most platforms available in the market.
