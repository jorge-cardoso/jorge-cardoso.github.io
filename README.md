# Skinny Bones Jekyll Starter

Just a little something I'm using to jump start a site refresh. Super alpha and super incomplete, use and abuse at your own risk.

Keep in mind, this is **not a theme** and will need styling and additional markup to really sing.

I'm currently using it on my website [Made Mistakes](http://mademistakes.com) with some modifications. To learn more about how to use the theme and install it check out the [Skinny Bones demo](http://mmistakes.github.io/skinny-bones-jekyll/) (*work in progress*).
