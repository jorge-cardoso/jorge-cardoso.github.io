Open Positions
--------------

Thanks for your interest in working with our applied research group at the 
[Huawei Munich Research Center](https://huawei.eu/research-and-innovation) or at the 
[University of Coimbra](https://www.uc.pt/en). 

If you are curious about systems, want to be challenged and engage in cutting edge research, propose novel ideas not proposed before, and leave your own mark on the academic world, you are probably a good candidate for a PhD.
While a MSc often involves the application of existing models and techniques, a PhD is almost totally independent and involve the creation of novel knowledge not know before. 

Our group has a special in interested in the following fields:

+ AI applied to cloud operations (AIOps)
+ Planet-scale cloud and edge computing
+ Machine learning, Deep learning, MLOps
+ Microservices, lambda functions, containers, distributed systems


Our group thrives to see the larger picture, be innovative and creative, and drive to make a lasting impact 
on planet-scale distributed system design and software systems. *We can't solve problems by using the same kind of thinking we used when we created them* -- Einstein.

We are always looking forward to work with excellent researchers which:

+ Simplify the complexity of existing technical solutions (KISS principle) 
+ Solve difficult technical problems (DIY principle)
+ Focus on the solution, not the obstacle
+ Translate theory into practice
