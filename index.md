I currently lead the **Ultra-scale AIOps Lab**. I take a dual role of
Chief Architect and Engineer Manager at [HUAWEI CLOUD](https://www.huaweicloud.com/intl/en-us/) in Munich, Germany and Dublin, Ireland.

We apply machine learning and deep learning techniques to various  areas related to [HUAWEI CLOUD](https://www.huaweicloud.com/intl/en-us/) such
as: anomaly detection, root cause analysis, failure prediction, reliability
and availability, risk estimation and security, network verification, and
low-latency object tracking.

Our work fits under the AI Engineering umbrella as discussed in [IEEE Software, Nov.-Dec. 2022](https://www.computer.org/csdl/magazine/so/2022/06).

Our current work involves the development of the **next generation of AI-driven
IT Operations tools and platforms**.
This field is generally called [AIOps](https://pt.slideshare.net/JorgeCardoso4/mastering-aiops-with-deep-learning) 
(artificial intelligence for IT operations).
In planet-scale deployments, the Operation and Maintenance (O&M) of cloud platforms
cannot be done any longer manually or simply with off-the-shelf solutions.

It requires self-developed automated systems, ideally exploiting the use of AI to provide tools for autonomous cloud operations. Our work looks into how **deep learning**, **machine learning**, **distributed traces**, **graph analysis**, **time-series analysis** (sequence analysis), and **log analysis** can be used to effectively **detect and localize anomalous cloud infrastructure behaviours** during operations to reduce the workload of human operators. 
These techniques are typically applied to Big Data coming from 
microservice observability data:
+ [A Survey of AIOps Methods for Failure Management](/rd/Papers/JA-2021-025-Survey_AIOps_Methods_for_Failure_Management.pdf), ACM TIST, 2021.

We create innovative systems for:

+ **Service health analysis**: Resource utilization (e.g., memory leaks), anomaly detection using KPI and logs
+ **Predictive analytics**: fault prevention, SW/HW failure prediction  
+ **Automated recovery**: fault localization and recovery
+ **Operational risk analysis**: CLI command analysis

We are currently developing the iForesight system which is being used to evaluate this new O&M approach.
iForesight 7.0 is the result of 7+ years of R&D with the goal to provide an
intelligent new tool aimed at [SRE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Site_Reliability_Engineering)
cloud maintenance teams. 
It enables them to quickly detect, localize and predict anomalies thanks 
to the use of artificial intelligence when cloud services are slow or 
unresponsive. 
Many of our innovation and system developments is done in collaboration with the [Technical University of Berlin](https://www.dos.tu-berlin.de/menue/datesnews/news/huawei_tub_innovation_lab_kick_off/) and the Huawei-TUB Innovation Lab for AI-driven Autonomous Operations.

About me
--------
After ~15 years of working for different industrial and academic research organizations (e.g., [SAP Research](http://go.sap.com/), [The Boeing Company](http://www.boeing.com), [CCG/Zentrum fur Graphische Datenverarbeitung](http://www.ccg.pt/en/), KIT, University of Dresden, University of Coimbra), Jorge joined [Huawei Munich Research Center](http://www.huawei.eu/research-and-innovation) as a Chief Architect for Ultra-scale AIOps in April 2015 with the mission of building a new team to develop innovative solutions which explore AI/ML to operate and manage the troubleshooting of [HUAWEI CLOUD](https://www.huaweicloud.com/intl/en-us/).

- As a strategist, he leads the vision, technical planning and research innovation roadmaps for applied AI to IT operation and maintenance.
- As a chief architect, he designs and implements AI-driven systems and algorithms.
- As an engineer manager, he leads 3 teams in the fields of AIOps, Edge AI and AI for Networks. 

Jorge enjoys his current role and is always seeking for new technological challenges and breakthroughs in the fields of cloud computing, artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things.

In 2021, he co-founded the Huawei-TUB Innovation Lab for AI-driven Autonomous Operations.
Jorge has published over 180 scientific publications in top peer-reviewed conferences and journals in the field of AI for IT operations, distributed systems, workflow management and semantic web ([10000+ citations, h-index 45+](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=n9JFmAkAAAAJ&hl=en)), and holds 10 patents on related fields. 
He serves as an associate editor of IEEE Software since 2014.
His latest book [Fundamentals of Service Systems](http://www.springer.com/de/book/9783319231945) compiles results from his research work in 2010-2015.
He created and led until 2009 the development of the [W3C Unified Service Description Language (USDL)](https://github.com/linked-usdl).
He participated in European, German, US, and National research projects financed by the  European Commission (FP7, EACEA), the German Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF), SAP Research (SAP)  and Portuguese NSF (FCT). He is a founding member of the IFIP Working Group 12.7 on Social Semantics. 
He is also Professor at the [University of Coimbra](https://www.uc.pt/en/fctuc/dei), and
affiliated to the Information Systems Group.

He has interests in the fields of Cloud Computing, AI, SRE, BPM, Semantic Web, Web Services, and Enterprise Systems (see [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=n9JFmAkAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao), [DBLP](http://dblp.uni-trier.de/pers/hd/c/Cardoso:Jorge), and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jorge-cardoso-75ba40/))

Jorge received his Ph.D. in Computer Science from the [University of Georgia](https://www.uga.edu), USA, and 
B.S. and M.S. degrees with top honors in Informatics Engineering from the [University of Coimbra](https://www.uc.pt/en/fctuc/dei), Portugal.

### Random info

I discovered by a random chance my passion in programming and computing when I was 14. My first computer was a [Timex Computer 2068](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timex_Sinclair_2068) and [BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC) was the first language I learned.

Our lab's culture of innovation and R&D is based on 5 main guiding principles:

+ [DIY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_it_yourself),
[KISS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle),
[Deep Work](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1455586692)*, 
[KPI-driven Research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_indicator), 
[Humorful](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jacquelynsmith/2013/05/03/10-reasons-why-humor-is-a-key-to-success-at-work/) 

+ (*) Time Spent x Intensity of Focus

*A good researcher says, "Lets find out", others say "Nobody knows". When a good researcher makes a mistake,
he says, I was  wrong", others say "It wasn't my fault". A good researcher works harder than others and has
more time. Others are always "too busy" to do what is necessary. [Unknown source]*
