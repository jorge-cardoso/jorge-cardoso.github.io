I am Associate Professor at the [University of Coimbra](http://www.uc.pt/en/fctuc/dei) (Portugal), and affiliated to the Information Systems Group. I am also Lead Architect for Cloud Management at [Huawei's European Research Center](http://www.huawei.eu/research-and-innovation) in Munich, Germany.

My current research involves the development of the next generation of Cloud Management Platforms ([CPM](http://www.gartner.com/it-glossary/cloud-management-platforms)), Cloud Automation solutions, Cloud Business Process Management (BPM), and High Performance BPM systems.

Research Interests
---------------

### [Cloud Reliability and Resilience](research/cloud_reliability_resilience)  
+ Developed new fault injection techniques to improve the reliability of complex, large distributed cloud platforms, such as the [Open Telekom Cloud](https://cloud.telekom.de/en/) from Deutsche Telekom.

+ Use [event processing technologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storm_(event_processor)) to detect  anomalies in cloud platforms in real time.

+ Adapt approaches from the field of data mining, such as [Bayesian networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_network) and [Markov processes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_process), to automatically detect and localize failures in cloud platforms.

+ Incorporate new resilient mechanisms into the [OpenStack](https://www.openstack.org) cloud operating system and [Huawei FusionSphere](http://e.huawei.com/en/products/cloud-computing-dc/cloud-computing/fusionsphere/fusionsphere) to increase its reliability and availability.

### Data Science
+ Use the open source Cloud platform [OpenStack](https://www.openstack.org) to provision services
+ Implement new algorithms from the field of Data Science to process streaming data using e.g., [Kafka](http://kafka.apache.org) and [Storm](http://storm.apache.org) and publish them as [microservices](http://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html). 
+ Use new workflow languages such as [Mistral](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Mistral) to orchestrate microservices 
+ Build POC to show the value of agregating these technologies to manage Clour Reliability and Large-scale Cloud Monitoring.

Events
---------------

+ On 23rd of March 2015 we organised an [SAP](http://www.sap.com) CodeJam event around SAP HANA Cloud Platform to demonstrate how Cloud Computing is being explored by companies. This event was part of the Service Engineering course of the Master in Computer Science. Take a look at some of the pictures and a more detailed description of the [CodeJam](http://scn.sap.com/community/events/codejam/blog/2015/03/25/sap-codejam-event-in-coimbra-sap-hana-cloud).

+ On February 2015, five students from the course Information Systems Management received the [ITIL](https://www.axelos.com/best-practice-solutions/itil/what-is-itil) Foundation certification. The certification was given in partnership with the consulting company [Deloitte](http://www2.deloitte.com/us/en.html?icid=global_site_selector_us). Congratulations to all.

Humour

<blockquote><p>
A good researcher says, "Lets find out", others say "Nobody knows". When a good researcher makes a mistake, he says, I was wrong", others say "It wasn't my fault". A good researcher works harder than others and has more time. Others are always "too busy" to do what is necessary.</p>
