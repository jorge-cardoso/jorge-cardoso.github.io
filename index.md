I am Chief Architect for Cloud OPerations and Analytics at [Huawei's European Research Center](http://www.huawei.eu/research-and-innovation) in Munich, Germany. I am also Associate Professor at the [University of Coimbra](http://www.uc.pt/en/fctuc/dei) (Portugal), and affiliated to the Information Systems Group.

My current research involves the development of the next generation of Cloud Management Platforms ([CPM](http://www.gartner.com/it-glossary/cloud-management-platforms)), Cloud Automation solutions, Cloud Business Process Management (BPM), and High Performance BPM systems. More precisely,

+ Develop new fault injection techniques to improve the reliability of complex, large distributed cloud platforms, such as the [Open Telekom Cloud](https://cloud.telekom.de/en/) from Deutsche Telekom.
+ Use [event processing technologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storm_(event_processor)) to detect  anomalies in cloud platforms in real time.
+ Adapt approaches from the field of data mining, such as [Bayesian networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_network) and [Markov processes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_process), to automatically detect and localize failures in cloud platforms.
+ Incorporate new resilient mechanisms into the [OpenStack](https://www.openstack.org) cloud operating system and [Huawei FusionSphere](http://e.huawei.com/en/products/cloud-computing-dc/cloud-computing/fusionsphere/fusionsphere) to increase its reliability and availability.

About me
---------------

Prof. Dr. Jorge Cardoso is Chief Architect for Cloud Operations and Analytics at [Huawei's European Research Center](http://www.huawei.eu/research-and-innovation) in Munich, Germany and Associate Professor at the [University of Coimbra](http://www.uc.pt/en), Portugal.

His current R&D work focuses on increasing the [Reliability of Cloud Platforms](research/) to support mission critical applications with [five nines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_nines).  The work is being done jointly by Huawei and Deutsche Telekom, and applied to the [Open Telekom Cloud](https://cloud.telekom.de/en/cloud-infrastructure/open-telekom-cloud/) operated by [T-Systems](https://www.t-systems.com) in Magdeburg. Our approach uses fault-injection techniques and conceptually follows the so-called [Chaos Engineering](http://techblog.netflix.com/2014/09/introducing-chaos-engineering.html) methodology from Netflix. The first prototypes were made available in Q2 2016 and a running system will be ready in Q1 2017.

Previously he worked for several major companies such as [SAP Research](http://go.sap.com/) (Germany) on the Internet of Services, [The Boeing Company](http://www.boeing.com) in Seattle (USA) on Enterprise Application Integration and [CCG/Zentrum fur Graphische Datenverarbeitung]( http://www.ccg.pt/en/) on Computer Supported Cooperative Work.

He has authored and co-authored more than 135 scientific publications and has been part of more than 120 program committees and organization bodies (journals and conferences). He his author/editor of 9 books. He holds a US and EU patents on “System and method of measuring process compliance” and “Multi-Phase High Performance Business Process Management System”. [GoogleScholar](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=n9JFmAkAAAAJ&hl=en) shows more than 6100 citations for his research work with an h-index of 36. His last book, titled [Fundamentals of Service Systems](http://www.springer.com/de/book/9783319231945) from Springer, compiles results from the research work of his areas of interest: cloud computing, business process management, semantic Web, the Internet of Services, and service engineering.

He participated in European, German, US, and National research projects financed by the European Commission (FP7, EACEA), the German Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF), SAP Research (SAP) and Portuguese NSF (FCT). He is a founding member of the IFIP Working Group 12.7 on Social Semantics. He created and led until 2009 the development of the W3C Unified Service Description Language (USDL).

He has a Ph.D. from the University of Georgia (US, 2002) and a MSc and BSc in Informatics Engineering University of Coimbra (1995 and 1998, Portugal).

<blockquote><p>
A good researcher says, "Lets find out", others say "Nobody knows". When a good researcher makes a mistake, he says, I was wrong", others say "It wasn't my fault". A good researcher works harder than others and has more time. Others are always "too busy" to do what is necessary.</p>
