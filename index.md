I am associate professor at the University of Coimbra, and affiliated to the Information Systems Group. 
I am currently involved in developing new types of Enterprise Systems using RDFS, SPARQL, Linked Data, Cloud Computing paradigms, and Service Descriptions. 
</p>

My main research interests include: semantic web, service systems, service description languages, and business process management.

####Service Descriptions 
<p>
<a href="https://github.com/linked-usdl">

Linked USDL (Unified Service Description Language) enables describing business, software, or real-world services using computer-readable and computer-understandable specifications to make them tradable on the web/Internet. It uses RDFS to provide a shared model. Check <a href="https://github.com/linked-usdl">Github</a> and <a href="http://www.linked-usdl.org">linked-usdl.org</a>

####Service Systems

</a>
The Linked Service System model for the Unified Service Description Language (LSS-USDL) explores the development of lightweight semantic models to capture the essence of service systems. Real service systems can be modeled with LSS-USDL, they can be accessed and queried programmatically, and they can be annotated with background knowledge. Check <a href="https://github.com/jorge-cardoso/lss-usdl">Github</a> and this recent book <a href="http://www.springer.com/computer/database+management+%26+information+retrieval/book/978-3-319-10812-4">Service Systems</a>.

####Service Networks 
<p>

</a>
Service networks are a class of networks of emerging interest since worldwide economies are becoming increasingly connected. Nonetheless, while the economies of many countries are becoming service-oriented, very few studies on service networks exist. We seek understanding when, why, where, and how service networks function best is fundamental for the future because their analysis can provide an ``x-ray'' of service-based economies.

About me
---------------
Prof. Dr. Jorge Cardoso is Associate Professor and joined the Information System Group at the University of Coimbra in 2009. He has authored/co-authored more than 125 scientific publications and has been part of more than 120 program committees and organization bodies (journals and conferences). He his author/editor of 9 books. He holds a US patent titled "System and method of measuring process compliance". GoogleScholar shows more than 4800 citations for his research work with an h-index of 31. He is currently writing his next book titled "Service networks: a service science discipline" which results from the research work of his areas of interest: business process management, semantic Web, the Internet of Services, and service engineering.

He has participated in European, German and National research projects financed by the European Commission (FP7), the Education, Audiovisual and Culture Executive Agency (EACEA), the German Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF), SAP Research (SAP) and Fundacao para a Ciencia e Technologia (FCT). Previously he worked for several major companies such as SAP Research (Germany) on the Internet of Services, the Boeing Company in Seattle (USA) on Enterprise Application Integration and CCG/Zentrum fur Graphische Datenverarbeitung on Computer Supported Cooperative Work. He gave lectures at the University of Madeira (Portugal) -- where he obtained tenure -- and the University of Georgia (USA). He is currently leading the Genssiz center for service systems research (10+ members). In the past, he has led 2 large research groups. One while at SAP Research in Germany (15+ members) and another one, the SEED Laboratory (10+ members), while at the University of Madeira.

He is a founding member of the IFIP Working Group 12.7 on Social Semantics. He created and led until 2009 the development of the W3C Unified Service Description Language (USDL). He regularly collaborates with the Knoesis Research Center (USA), the University of Georgia (USA), the University of Bayreuth (DE), the University of Eindhoven (NL), the Open University (UK), The University of Stuttgart (DE), SAP Research (DE), among others. His teaching, training, and consulting activities both in academia and in industry cover topics related to Service Management, Enterprise Architecture, Middleware technologies, and Semantic Web. He is an ISACA Academic Advocate (ISACA is a Worldwide association of IS professionals dedicated to the audit, control, and security of information systems).

He completed his graduate studies with a Ph.D. from the University of Georgia (US) in 2002 and his undergraduate studies at the University of Coimbra, Portugal with a MSc and BSc in Informatics Engineering in 1995 and 1998, respectively.
His current research interests are in the areas of Service models, cloud computing, service networks, service relationships, semantic web, service dynamics, business process management.

<blockquote><p>
A good researcher says, "Lets find out", others say "Nobody knows". When a good researcher makes a mistake, he says, I was wrong", others say "It wasn't my fault". A good researcher works harder than others and has more time. Others are always "too busy" to do what is necessary.</p>
