I currently lead the **Ultra-scale AIOps Lab**. I take a dual role of
Chief Architect and Engineer Manager at  
[HUAWEI CLOUD](https://www.huaweicloud.com/intl/en-us/) in Munich, Germany and Dublin, Ireland.

Using machine learning and deep learning techniques, we apply AI to various
areas related to [HUAWEI CLOUD](https://www.huaweicloud.com/intl/en-us/) such
as: anomaly detection, root cause analysis, failure prediction, reliability
and availability, risk estimation and security, network verification, and
low-latency object tracking. Our work fits under the AI Engineering umbrella
as discussed in [IEEE Software, Nov.-Dec. 2022](https://www.computer.org/csdl/magazine/so/2022/06).



Cloud Reliability
-----------------

Our current work involves the development of the **next generation of AI-driven
IT Operations tools and platforms**.
This field is generally called [AIOps](https://pt.slideshare.net/JorgeCardoso4/mastering-aiops-with-deep-learning) 
(artificial intelligence for IT operations).
In planet-scale deployments, the Operation and Maintenance (O&M) of cloud platforms
cannot be done any longer manually or simply with off-the-shelf solutions. 

<img src="./images/Cloud_edge_device.png" height="300" width="600" style="float:right;margin:20px 20px 20px 20px;"/>

It requires self-developed automated systems, ideally exploiting the use of AI to provide tools for autonomous cloud operations. Our work looks into how **deep learning**, **machine learning**, **distributed traces**, **graph analysis**, **time-series analysis** (sequence analysis), and **log analysis** can be used to effectively **detect and localize anomalous cloud infrastructure behaviours** during operations to reduce the workload of human operators. 
These techniques are typically applied to Big Data coming from 
microservice observability data:
+ [A Survey of AIOps Methods for Failure Management](/publications/Papers/JA-2021-025-Survey_AIOps_Methods_for_Failure_Management.pdf), ACM TIST, 2021.

We create innovative systems for:

+ **Service health analysis**: Resource utilization (e.g., memory leaks), anomaly detection using KPI and logs
+ **Predictive analytics**: fault prevention, SW/HW failure prediction  
+ **Automated recovery**: fault localization and recovery
+ **Operational risk analysis**: CLI command analysis

We are currently developing the iForesight system which is being used to
evaluate this new O&M approach. [iForesight 7.0](/projects/iforesight) is 
the result of more than 6 years of R&D with the goal to provide an
intelligent new tool aimed at [SRE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Site_Reliability_Engineering)
cloud maintenance teams. 
It enables them to quickly detect, localize and predict anomalies thanks 
to the use of artificial intelligence when cloud services are slow or 
unresponsive. 
Many of our innovation and system developments is done in collaboration with the [Technical University of Berlin](https://www.dos.tu-berlin.de/menue/datesnews/news/huawei_tub_innovation_lab_kick_off/) and the Huawei-TUB Innovation Lab for AI-driven Autonomous Operations.

### Random info

I discovered by a random chance my passion in programming and computing when I was 14. My first computer was a [Timex Computer 2068](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timex_Sinclair_2068) and [BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC) was the first language I learned.

Our lab's culture of innovation and R&D is based on 5 main guiding principles:

+ [DIY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_it_yourself),
[KISS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle),
[Deep Work](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1455586692)*, 
[KPI-driven Research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_indicator), 
[Humorful](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jacquelynsmith/2013/05/03/10-reasons-why-humor-is-a-key-to-success-at-work/)

> A good researcher says, "Lets find out", others say "Nobody knows". When a good researcher makes a mistake, he says, I was  wrong", others say "It wasn't my fault". A good researcher works harder than others and has more time. Others are always "too busy" to do what is necessary. [Unknown source]
