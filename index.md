I am associate professor at the [University of Coimbra](http://www.uc.pt/en/fctuc/dei) (Portugal), and affiliated to the Information Systems Group.

I am also Lead Architect for Cloud Management at [Huawei's European Research Center](http://www.huawei.eu/research-and-innovation) in Munich, Germany.

My current research involves the development of the next generation of Cloud Management Platforms ([CPM](http://www.gartner.com/it-glossary/cloud-management-platforms)), Cloud Automation solutions, Cloud Business Process Management (BPM), and High Performance BPM systems.

Events
---------------

+ On 23rd of March 2015 we organised an [SAP](http://www.sap.com) CodeJam event around SAP HANA Cloud Platform to demonstrate how Cloud Computing is being explored by companies. This event was part of the Service Engineering course of the Master in Computer Science. Take a look at some of the pictures and a more detailed description of the [CodeJam](http://scn.sap.com/community/events/codejam/blog/2015/03/25/sap-codejam-event-in-coimbra-sap-hana-cloud).

+ On February 2015, five students from the course Information Systems Management received the [ITIL](https://www.axelos.com/best-practice-solutions/itil/what-is-itil) Foundation certification. The certification was given in partnership with the consulting company [Deloitte](http://www2.deloitte.com/us/en.html?icid=global_site_selector_us). Congratulations to all.





Research
---------------

####Service Analytics

Currently, I am working on Service Analytics. We analyse large logs from IT service provisioning (e.g., ITIL) to find human behaviour patterns which are rewarded or penalized. Interesting work. It is the new challenge for companies, the future so to say: to analyse people behaviour... My new upcoming book on Service Systems  Fundamentals/Springer will have a chapter dedicated to the topic.


####Service Descriptions
<p>

</a>
Linked USDL (Unified Service Description Language) enables describing business, software, or real-world services using computer-readable and computer-understandable specifications to make them tradable on the web/Internet. It uses RDFS to provide a shared model. Check <a href="https://github.com/linked-usdl">Github</a> and <a href="http://www.linked-usdl.org">linked-usdl.org</a>
</p>

Bellow is an earlier video explaining the goal of USDL (please note that since then, XML has been replaced by RDFS).

####Service Systems
<p>
<a href="https://github.com/jorge-cardoso/lss-usdl">
<img src="/images/Logo-LSS-USDL.png" width="200"  style="float:left;margin:0 20px 0 0;"/>
</a>
The Linked Service System model for the Unified Service Description Language (LSS-USDL) explores the development of lightweight semantic models to capture the essence of service systems. Real service systems can be modeled with LSS-USDL, they can be accessed and queried programmatically, and they can be annotated with background knowledge. Check <a href="https://github.com/jorge-cardoso/lss-usdl">Github</a> and this recent book <a href="http://www.springer.com/computer/database+management+%26+information+retrieval/book/978-3-319-10812-4">Service Systems</a>.

####Service Networks
<p>
<a href="https://github.com/linked-usdl">
<img src="/images/Logo-Service-Network.png" height="128" width="155"  style="float:left;margin:0 20px 0 0;"/>
</a>
Service networks are a class of networks of emerging interest since worldwide economies are becoming increasingly connected. Nonetheless, while the economies of many countries are becoming service-oriented, very few studies on service networks exist. We seek understanding when, why, where, and how service networks function best is fundamental for the future because their analysis can provide an ``x-ray'' of service-based economies.

One while at SAP Research in Germany (15+ members) and another one, the SEED Laboratory (10+ members), while at the University of Madeira.

He is a founding member of the IFIP Working Group 12.7 on Social Semantics. He created and led until 2009 the development of the W3C Unified Service Description Language (USDL). He regularly collaborates with the Knoesis Research Center (USA), the University of Georgia (USA), the University of Bayreuth (DE), the University of Eindhoven (NL), the Open University (UK), The University of Stuttgart (DE), SAP Research (DE), among others.

His teaching, training, and consulting activities both in academia and in industry cover topics related to Service Management, Enterprise Architecture, Middleware technologies, and Semantic Web. He is an ISACA Academic Advocate (ISACA is a Worldwide association of IS professionals dedicated to the audit, control, and security of information systems). Since 2014 he is the Coordinator of the MSc program on Engineering Informatics at the University of Coimbra.

He completed his graduate studies with a Ph.D. from the University of Georgia (US) in 2002 and his undergraduate studies at the University of Coimbra, Portugal with a MSc and BSc in Informatics Engineering in 1995 and 1998, respectively.
His current research interests are in the areas of Service models, cloud computing, service networks, service relationships, semantic web, service dynamics, business process management.




Humour

<blockquote><p>
A good researcher says, "Lets find out", others say "Nobody knows". When a good researcher makes a mistake, he says, I was wrong", others say "It wasn't my fault". A good researcher works harder than others and has more time. Others are always "too busy" to do what is necessary.</p>
