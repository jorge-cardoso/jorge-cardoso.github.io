I am Chief Architect for **Inteligent Cloud Operations** at 
[Huawei Munich Research Center](http://www.huawei.eu/research-and-innovation) in Munich, Germany.
I am also Associate Professor at the [University of Coimbra](http://www.uc.pt/en/fctuc/dei) (Portugal), and
affiliated to the Information Systems Group.

My current research involves the development of the **next generation of AI-driven IT Operations tools and platforms**.
This field in nowadays generally called [AIOps](https://pt.slideshare.net/JorgeCardoso4/mastering-aiops-with-deep-learning) 
(artificial intelligence for IT operations).
In planet-scale deployments, the Operation and Maintenance (O&M) of cloud platforms cannot be done any longer manually
or simply with off-the-shelf solutions. It requires self-developed automated systems, ideally exploiting the use of AI
to provide tools for autonomous cloud operations. My research looks into how **deep learning**, **machine learning 
learning**, **distributed traces**, **graph analysis**, **time-series analysis** (sequence analysis), and **log analysis** can be used 
to effectively **detect and localize anomalous cloud infrastructure behaviors** during operations to reduce the 
workload of human operators. These techniques are typically applied to Big Data coming from 
microservice [observability data](https://www.mstakx.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/A-Practical-Observability-Primer-1.pdf).

My group is currently developing the iForesight system which is being used to evaluate this new O&M approach. 
[iForesight 3.0](research/iforesight) is the result of more than 2 years of research with
the goal to provide an intelligent new tool aimed at [SRE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Site_Reliability_Engineering)
cloud maintenance teams. 
It enables them to quickly detect, localize and predict anomalies thanks to the use of artificial intelligence when
cloud services are slow or unresponsive. 

The basic research areas we touch and integrate include:
+ Cloud computing.
+ Machine learning.
+ Deep learning.
+ Distributed systems.
+ Software reliability.

They are applied to create new and innovative systems for:
+ AI-driven Cloud Operations
+ Fault prevention, prediction, detection, localization, and recovery.  
+ Planet-scale monitoring of distributed systems
+ Applied machine learning for predictive software maintenance
+ Natural Language Processing for systems’ behaviour analysis.

Previously I also looked into Cloud Computing, BPM, Semantic Web, Web Services, and Enterprise Systems.
