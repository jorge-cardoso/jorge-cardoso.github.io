I am Chief Architect for **Intelligent Cloud Operations (aka AIOps)** at **Huawei Munich Research Center** in Munich, Germany and **Huawei Ireland Research Center** in Dublin, Ireland.
I am also Associate Professor at the [University of Coimbra](http://www.uc.pt/en/fctuc/dei) (Portugal), and
affiliated to the Information Systems Group.

I also have interests in Cloud Computing, BPM, Semantic Web, Web Services, and Enterprise Systems (see [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=n9JFmAkAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao), [DBLP](http://dblp.uni-trier.de/pers/hd/c/Cardoso:Jorge), and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jorge-cardoso-75ba40/))

Today, using machine learning and deep learning techniques, we apply AI to various area of [HUAWEI CLOUD](https://www.huaweicloud.com/intl/en-us/) datacenters such as: anomaly detection, root cause analysis, failure prediction, reliability and availability, risk estimation and security, network verification, and low-latency object tracking.
The areas are explored in three fields:

+ **Ultra-scale AIOps**. We apply analytics and machine learning (ML) techniques to automate IT operations and maintenance. We collect operational data from IT infrastructures, leverage big data and AI platforms to automatically detect and predict failures in datacenters and cloud platforms in real-time.

<img src="/images/Cloud_edge_device.png" height="300" width="600" style="float:right;margin:0px 20px 20px 20px;"/>

+ **Edge AI**. We bring ML algorithms, computation and data storage closer to the devices where data is generated. This local computation allows to process data with devices with a very low latency. Examples of use cases include video surveillance and  health monitoring. 

+ **AI for Networks**. We leverage ML to automate routine tasks, such as verification, configuration, optimization and troubleshooting. The new algorithms and tools developed enable network operators and architects with key network insights and actionable information.

Ultra-scale AIOps
-----------------

Our current research involves the development of the **next generation of AI-driven IT Operations tools and platforms**.
This field in nowadays generally called [AIOps](https://pt.slideshare.net/JorgeCardoso4/mastering-aiops-with-deep-learning) 
(artificial intelligence for IT operations).
In planet-scale deployments, the Operation and Maintenance (O&M) of cloud platforms cannot be done any longer manually
or simply with off-the-shelf solutions. 
It requires self-developed automated systems, ideally exploiting the use of AI to provide tools for autonomous cloud operations. My research looks into how **deep learning**, **machine learning learning**, **distributed traces**, **graph analysis**, **time-series analysis** (sequence analysis), and **log analysis** can be used to effectively **detect and localize anomalous cloud infrastructure behaviors** during operations to reduce the workload of human operators. 
These techniques are typically applied to Big Data coming from 
microservice [observability data](https://www.mstakx.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/A-Practical-Observability-Primer-1.pdf).

They are applied to create new and innovative systems for:

+ AI-driven Cloud Operations
+ Fault prevention, prediction, detection, localization, and recovery.  
+ Planet-scale monitoring of distributed systems
+ Applied machine learning for predictive software maintenance
+ Natural Language Processing for systemsâ€™ behaviour analysis.

We are currently developing the iForesight system which is being used to evaluate this new O&M approach. 
[iForesight 3.0](/research/iforesight) is the result of more than 2 years of research with
the goal to provide an intelligent new tool aimed at [SRE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Site_Reliability_Engineering)
cloud maintenance teams. 
It enables them to quickly detect, localize and predict anomalies thanks to the use of artificial intelligence when
cloud services are slow or unresponsive. 

We have already published several papers in this field:

Edge AI
-------

In recent years, cloud computing has become a central part of the AI evolution. To better address requirements, businesses are becoming aware of the need to bring the technology closer to customers. Thus, Edge AI is emerging as a solution that uses ML to process data generated at the local level. The market is expected to grow in value from [$355 million in 2018 to $1.12 trillion by 2023](https://www.marketwatch.com/press-release/global-edge-ai-software-market-size-share-to-expand-at-203-cagr-through-2027-2021-03-18?tesla=y). 

Cloud-centric approaches face several limitations such as network latency and bandwidth constraints. While the edge model considerably reduces transmission costs and latency requirements, it raises questions with respect to computational models, system architectures, AI pipelines and reliability concerns. An example of this technology is Amazon Alexa which learns and stores phrases locally using AI. When a user gives a verbal command, the device sends the voice recording to an edge network where it is transformed to text using AI algorithms. Without an edge network, the response time would be seconds, with edge the latency is reduced to <400 ms. For example, [Intelligent EdgeFabric](https://support.huaweicloud.com/intl/en-us/productdesc-ief/ief_productdesc_0001.html) provides a complete edge computing solution, in which cloud applications are extended to the edge. Edge nodes and applications can be managed remotely (e.g., device monitoring, application monitoring, and log collection) and data process localy. 

As a starting point, our project relies on a use case fromt he field of [video analytics](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/12/1/14). It involves multi-camera surveillance systems, OCR and real-time object tracking. The cameras monitor containers in a transportation chain, while ML compiles data in real time for the container tracking process. The use case is used to identify new computational models at the edge. It is implemented to demonstrate how edge platforms should be designed to manage AI-driven applications.

To support the reference use case, data needs are collected, stored, processed, analyzed, and visualized across the distributed components of edge platforms using AI. The implementation supports training, deployment, and inferencing ML models optimized to provide services with low latency for end users. The output is a set of new computing models, training/inference patterns and libraries/algorithms supporting use 

The final system will be used to experiment and evaluate various computational models and architecture configurations, derive latency and bandwidth constraints, and explore how high levels of reliability can be achieved. Afterwards, the findings, namely the new computing models identified, will be translated into new functionalities of the open source software framework [Sedna](https://github.com/kubeedge/sedna) and [Kubeedge](https://github.com/kubeedge/kubeedge).

Our approach leverages the following techniques: 

+ [Architectures for deep learning inference](http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~jiasi/pub/deep_edge_review.pdf)
+ [Training and inference at the edge](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.08349)
+ Model selection, pruning, quantization, scarification, parameter tuning, offloading, partitioning, caching, etc.
+ [DL models](https://github.com/onnx/models): CNN, LSTM, AlexNet, Yolo, MXNet, GoogleNet, etc.
+ [Sedna Open source Edge AI frameworks](https://github.com/kubeedge/sedna)



AI for Networks
---------------

Gartner research indicates that 70% of network operations are still performed manually. Other surveys indicate that misconfigurations are the root cause of 75% of network outages and performance issues. This leads to high MTTR (mean time to resolve) KPIs since problems are only observed in production. 

Thus, we are building a network monitoring and verification platform driven by AI for real-time intelligent network verification in cloud datacenters. 
Our work is related to  Google [Network Intelligence Center](https://cloud.google.com/network-intelligence-center), formal verification at [AWS](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-96145-3_3), template inference using [SelfStarter](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~todd/research/nsdi20.pdf) and active monitoring using [Pingmesh](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2785956.2787496) both from Microsoft.

Our approach leverages the following techniques: 

+ AI/ML
+ Mixed-integer/constraint programming. and SAT constraint solvers
+ Network programmability and programmable switches
+ SmartNICS/FPGAs

As a step in the field of AI for Networks, we are organizing the [1st Network Verification Workshop](https://networkverification-workshop.github.io/) to provide a forum for the community to come together and rethink fundamental questions, breakthrough solutions in Network Verification in summer 2021.
