	The inherent complexity of the new wave of services that is emerging

	In this chapter a novel service engineering framework is introduced:
	the Integrated Service Engineering (ISE) framework. With its ISE
	workbench, it can address the emerging requirements of Internet of
	services. The chapter presents the foundations on how the service
	engineering process can be conducted by applying the separation of
	concerns to model different service dimensions within various layers
	of abstraction. Additionally, three novel extensions are presented
	to the aforementioned ISE workbench in order to enrich the capabilities
	of the service modeling process.},

	In our approach, we selected a commercial SaaS CRM platform, modeled
	it using the service description language USDL, modeled its cloud
	deployment using TOSCA, and constructed a prototypical platform to
	integrate service selection with deployment. Our evaluation indicates
	that a high level of integration is possible. We were able to fully
	automatize the remote deployment of a cloud service after it was
	selected by a customer in a marketplace. Architectural decisions
	emerged during the construction of the platform and were related

	Currently, there is a lack of understanding of these two classes

	are poorly supported since they are created using generic software

	In this paper, we explore a systematic development approach, called

	economy, i.e. a complex network composed of national economies, which
	are themselves networks of markets, and markets are also networks

  abstract = {Digital services emerging from Service Science call for research in
	areas as diverse as business, law, economics, behavior, and psychology
	to systematically design services. Current research and approaches
	have mainly developed intricate theories, methodologies, and apparatus
	to invent, design, engineer and trade services. These solutions are
	to be used by large organizations since their complexity hinders
	their use by small and medium enterprises (SME). Based on this observation,
	this paper provides an overview of research areas which needs to
	be explored to provide the first building blocks and foundations
	to enable a widespread trading of services by non-IT professionals
	and SME.},

	not created based on an established science and operated without
	a systematic approach, will be digitalized using proper methodologies,
	standards, and tools. The digital specification of services will
	enable their trading over the Internet using electronic marketplaces.
	This paper provides four main contributions to the IoS research:
	a definition and characterization for the concept of IoS-based service,
	the role and importance of platform services for the IoS, the challenges
	of managing SLA dependencies between IoS-based services in compositions,
	and a model-based approach for service engineering that can be used
	to design IoS-based services.},

	is one important aspect which has not received the required attention.
	Nonetheless, its impact on the economic success of service-based
	industries is considerable and, so, it cannot be overlooked. Therefore,
	in this paper we tackle the problem of cost prediction of service
	systems. Since previous work generally followed an ad hoc approach,
	we present a three layered approach based on customer factors to
	measure customer involvement since it is a good predictor for service
	cost. Service co-creation between customer and provider is the central
	concept of our costing approach. For service modelling we use Linked
	USDL, and to reason on costing data we use methods from service analytics.
	On the one hand, we reduce the uncertainty introduced by customers
	and can predict more accurate service costs. On the other hand, the
	systematic approach enables a better understanding of the costing
	problem and the service systems under study, and increases reusability
	of service analytics algorithms.},

	predictability and safety of their operation, is difficult without
	an extra layer of intelligence that will ensure the orchestration
	of these various actors according to well-defined goals, taking into
	account changing constraints, business objectives or regulations.
	This chapter introduces such a layer. Our extensions to the semantic
	technologies will provide cross-layer communication services (data-level
	interoperability) to the entities on the Internet of Things, and
	extended multi-agent technologies will provide collaboration-support
	services (functional protocol-level interoperability and coordination)
	for these entities. We present the PRIME inter-middleware as an intended
	extension of the recently designed UBIWARE platform, which connects
	heterogeneous, both industrial and non-industrial, resources belonging
	to different layers of the Internet of Things. We consider the three
	layers of physical devices, software, and humans interconnected through
	the Middleware-as-a-Service platforms that are normally used for
	connecting relatively homogeneous resources at the respective individual
	layers.},
