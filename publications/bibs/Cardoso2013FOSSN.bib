Understanding what factors explain	the structure and dynamics of global service networks may lead to	a more efficient and balanced society and economy. The concept of	service network is formally represented as a business structure made	up of services systems which are nodes connected by one or more specific	types of relationships. They can be used to represent the global	economy, i.e. a complex network composed of national economies, which	are themselves networks of markets, and markets are also networks	of providers, brokers, intermediaries, and consumers. The authors'	key challenge consists in developing a novel perspective on socio-economic	dynamics by connecting service models representing service systems	(e.g. consulting, governmental, and educational services). Theories	to be developed will enable to understand, describe, explain, analyze,	predict, and control the evolution of global service networks.},  owner = {jcardoso},  timestamp = {20132.01.29},  webpdf = {/Papers/JA-2013-021-IJSSMET-OSSN.pdf}}
