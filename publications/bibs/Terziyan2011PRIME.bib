@article{Terziyan2011PRIME,	abstract = {Enabling interoperability between a large number of heterogeneous	entities (devices, software, humans, abstractions, etc.), while ensuring	predictability and safety of their operation, is difficult without	an extra layer of intelligence that will ensure the orchestration	of these various actors according to well-defined goals, taking into	account changing constraints, business objectives or regulations.	This chapter introduces such a layer. Our extensions to the semantic	technologies will provide cross-layer communication services (data-level	interoperability) to the entities on the Internet of Things, and	extended multi-agent technologies will provide collaboration-support	services (functional protocol-level interoperability and coordination)	for these entities. We present the PRIME inter-middleware as an intended	extension of the recently designed UBIWARE platform, which connects	heterogeneous, both industrial and non-industrial, resources belonging	to different layers of the Internet of Things. We consider the three	layers of physical devices, software, and humans interconnected through	the Middleware-as-a-Service platforms that are normally used for	connecting relatively homogeneous resources at the respective individual	layers.},	author = {Vagan Terziyan and Artem Katasonov and Jorge Cardoso and Manfred Hauswirth and Anirban Majumdar},	date-added = {2018-04-25 20:02:07 +0000},	date-modified = {2018-04-25 20:02:07 +0000},	journal = {Eastern-European Journal of Enterprise Technologies},	number = {3/12},	owner = {jcardoso},	pages = {3-16},	timestamp = {2011.07.14},	title = {PRIME: Proactive Inter-Middleware for Global Enterprise Resource Integration},	volume = {51},	webpdf = {/Papers/JA-2011-018-EEJET-PRIME-middleware.pdf},	year = {2011}}
