@inproceedings{Cardoso13OSNDirections,	abstract = {Service networks are a new research field which promises to increase	our knowledge of service-based systems. Understanding what factors	explain the evolution of global service networks can lead to more	effcient and balanced infrastructures. The challenge consists in	developing a novel perspective by connecting models representing	services (e.g. cloud computing and governmental services) into networks.	Theories, methods, and applications to be developed will enable,	afterwards, to understand, describe, explain, analyse, predict, and	control the structure and behaviour of global service networks.},	author = {Jorge Cardoso},	booktitle = {Proceedings of C3S2E'13},	date-added = {2018-04-25 20:02:07 +0000},	date-modified = {2018-04-25 20:02:07 +0000},	editor = {Ana Almeida and Jorge Bernardino and Sudhir Mudur},	organization = {ACM},	owner = {jcardoso},	pages = {2-3},	timestamp = {2013.07.14},	title = {Open Service Networks: Research Directions},	webpdf = {/Papers/CP-2013-069-C3S2E12-OSN-Directions.pdf},	year = {2013}}
