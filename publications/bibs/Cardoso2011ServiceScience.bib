@inproceedings{Cardoso2011ServiceScience,	abstract = {Digital services emerging from Service Science call for research in	areas as diverse as business, law, economics, behavior, and psychology	to systematically design services. Current research and approaches	have mainly developed intricate theories, methodologies, and apparatus	to invent, design, engineer and trade services. These solutions are	to be used by large organizations since their complexity hinders	their use by small and medium enterprises (SME). Based on this observation,	this paper provides an overview of research areas which needs to	be explored to provide the first building blocks and foundations	to enable a widespread trading of services by non-IT professionals	and SME.},	author = {Jorge Cardoso and Paulo Rupino},	booktitle = {Workshop on Enterprise Systems and Technology (I-WEST 2011)},	date-added = {2018-04-25 20:02:07 +0000},	date-modified = {2018-04-25 20:02:07 +0000},	owner = {jcardoso},	timestamp = {2011.07.01},	title = {Service Science: concepts, tools and platforms to support digital services for SME},	webpdf = {/Papers/WP-2011-061-IWEST-Service-Science-concepts.pdf},	year = {2011}}
