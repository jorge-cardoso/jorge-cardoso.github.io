The inherent complexity of the new wave of services that is emerging	requires new approaches for an effective and efficient service design.	In this chapter a novel service engineering framework is introduced:	the Integrated Service Engineering (ISE) framework. With its ISE	workbench, it can address the emerging requirements of Internet of	services. The chapter presents the foundations on how the service	engineering process can be conducted by applying the separation of	concerns to model different service dimensions within various layers	of abstraction. Additionally, three novel extensions are presented	to the aforementioned ISE workbench in order to enrich the capabilities	of the service modeling process.},  booktitle = {Modern Software Engineering Concepts and Practices: Advanced Approaches},  isbn = {1609602153},  owner = {Jorge Cardoso},  url = {http://www.igi-global.com/bookstore/titledetails.aspx?TitleId=46012},  webpdf = {/Papers/BC-2011-030-IGI-Modeling-services-using-ISE-framework.pdf}}
