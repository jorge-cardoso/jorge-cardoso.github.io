@article{Cardoso08WebSerJour,	Abstract = {The article offers information on business process control-flow complexity.	It states that organizations are increasingly exposed to the challenge	of managing business processes, Web processes, and workflows. It	also mentions that one important feature of business processes that	has been left out is their complexity. Moreover, high complexity	in processes may result in poor comprehension, errors and defects,	leading processes to need more time to establish, test, and maintain.	The authors present a metric which they used in analyzing the control-flow	complexity of business processes.},	Address = {University of Madeira, Portugal and SAP AG Research, Germany},	Author = {Cardoso, Jorge},	Date-Added = {2018-04-25 20:02:07 +0000},	Date-Modified = {2018-04-25 20:02:07 +0000},	Issn = {15457362},	Journal = {International Journal of Web Services Research},	Keywords = {SAP},	Number = {2},	Owner = {Jorge Cardoso},	Pages = {49-76},	Refid = {173},	Timestamp = {2010.08.26},	Title = {Business Process Control-Flow Complexity: Metric, Evaluation, and Validation},	Url = {http://www.igi-global.com/bookstore/titledetails.aspx?titleid=1079},	Volume = {5},	Webpdf = {/Papers/JA-2008-017-JWSR-Business-Process-Control-Flow-Complexity-proof.pdf},	Year = {2008},	Bdsk-Url-1 = {http://www.igi-global.com/bookstore/titledetails.aspx?titleid=1079}}
