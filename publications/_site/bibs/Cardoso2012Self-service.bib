@inproceedings{Cardoso2012Self-service,	Abstract = {Many worldwide economies have moved away from manufacturing and became	service-oriented. As a consequence, research on Internet-based Self-Services	(ISS) will foster the uptake of service exports and trading since	they can replace many face-to-face interactions and make service	transactions more accurate, convenient and faster. Currently, ISS	are poorly supported since they are created using generic software	techniques and development methods. Systematic methods are needed	and must go beyond service design, a well established research area,	to account also for service analysis, implementation, and deployment.	In this paper, we explore a systematic development approach, called	SEASIDE, based on four scientific advances: enterprise architectures	(EA), model-driven developments (MDD), model-view-controller pattern	(MVC), and platform as a service (PaaS). By selecting the Incident	Management service from the Information Technology Infrastructure	Library, we have evaluated our approach. Our research indicates that	the proposed method enables to focus on the business and design side	of services, and reduce development time and costs.},	Address = {Hawaii, USA},	Author = {Jorge Cardoso and John A.
