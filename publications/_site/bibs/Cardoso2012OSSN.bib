abstract = {Online service marketplaces will soon be part of the economy to scale	the provision of specialized multi-party services through automation	and standardization. Current research, such as the *-USDL service	description language family, is already defining the basic building	blocks to model the next generation of business services. Nonetheless,	the developments being made do not target to interconnect services	via service relationships. Without the concept of relationship, marketplaces	will be seen as mere functional silos containing service descriptions.	Yet, in real economies, all services are related and connected. Therefore,	to address this gap we introduce the concept of open semantic service	network (OSSN), concerned with the establishment of rich relationships	between services. These networks will provide valuable knowledge	on the global service economy, which can be exploited for many socio-economic	and scientific purposes such as service network analysis, management,	and control.},
