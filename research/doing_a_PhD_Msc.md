Thanks for your interest in working with our applied research group at the 
[Huawei Munich Research Center](https://huawei.eu/research-and-innovation) or at the 
[University of Coimbra](https://www.uc.pt/en). Our group has a special in interested in the following fields:

+ AI applied to cloud operations (AIOps)
+ Planet-scale cloud computing.
+ Machine learning.
+ Distributed systems.
+ Other fields (see my [Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=n9JFmAkAAAAJ&hl=en)).

Our group thrives to see the larger picture, be innovative and creative, and drive to make a lasting impact 
on planet-scale distributed system design and software systems. *We can't solve problems by using the same kind of thinking
we used when we created them* -- Einstein.

We are always looking forward to work with excellent researchers which:
+ Simplify the complexity of existing technical solutions (KISS principle) 
+ Solve difficult technical problems (DIY principle)
+ Focus on the solution, not the obstacle
+ Translate theory into practice
