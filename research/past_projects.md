Past Projects
------------------------------
###Semantic Domain System

<img align="right" src="/images/sds.gif" width="100">

Enterprises have the need to communicate. In business to business applications, usually XML is used to automatically exchange information. But sometimes more semantics is needed. Enterprises  also need to share concepts, terms, definitions and relationships (between concepts) relevant to their business activities.

Why are developing the Semantic Domain System which is a systems that follows similar concepts from the DNS.
The Domain Name System or DNS, is a service where relationships between IP addresses and physical domains are stored.
When you request your browser, email client, ftp client or any other application to search for a specific domain,
it automatically calls the DNS Server and finds the IP for the machine that offers the required service. It enables
the use of names instead of IP addresses. Each company is responsible for maintaining their own IP addresses.

In SDS, like in DNS, each company is responsible for managing their own concepts and is able to browse other companies'
concept definitions. The system will allow a clear representation of concepts and relationships between concepts.

###Semantic B2B Integration

</a>

B2B integration, also known as external IS integration and e-business integration, has promised to automate and
integrate business processes and interactions between companies by considerably renovating the way business was
conducted with partners, suppliers, and customers. B2B integration is fundamentally about data and information
exchange among businesses and their information systems. The ability to interact and exchange information both
internally and with external organizations (partners, suppliers, customers) is a fundamental issue in the enterprise sector.

One simple solution that organizations have adopted to reach a higher level of integration relied on the use of XML as the
language to represent data. XML has become a de facto standard of B2B because of its simplicity, extensibility and ease of
processing. Today its estimated that most organizations use XML to store and transfer data. This is the reason why we created
B2BISS (Business-to-Business Integration using Syntactic-to-Semantic Mapping).

### JXML2OWL

</a>

Today's enterprises face critical needs in integrating disparate information spread over several data sources inside
and even outside the organization. Semantic web technologies, such as ontologies, play an important role in the semantic
integration of data. The purpose of JXMLOWL is to present a framework to assist the semantic data integration process.
The framework supports mappings and instances transformation from syntactic data sources in XML format to a common
global model defined by an ontology using semantic web related technologies such as OWL.


### Business Process Quality Metrics

<a href="BPQM/bpqm.html">

</a>

Our intentions are twofold. On the one hand, we think it is fundamental to survey findings from neighboring disciplines on
how Business Process Quality Metrics can be developed. In particular, we believe that we can gather additional insights from
software engineering, cognitive science, and graph theory and relate them to business process modeling. A further empirical
investigation might ultimately lead to establishing a complexity theory of business process models. On the other hand, we plan to
demonstrate that these metrics serves their purpose, we plan to carry out several empirical validations by means of controlled experiments.
