Service Systems
---------------

Our recent research places emphasis on three fields: service description languages (with the USDL family), 
service system modeling (with the LSS USDL language), service analytics (using process mining), and 
service networks (using principals from social networks).

### Service Analytics

Currently, I am working on Service Analytics. We analyse large logs from IT service provisioning (e.g., ITIL) to find human behaviour patterns which are rewarded or penalized. Interesting work. It is the new challenge for companies, the future so to say: to analyse people behaviour... My new upcoming book on Service Systems  Fundamentals/Springer will have a chapter dedicated to the topic.

### Service Descriptions

Linked USDL (Unified Service Description Language) enables describing business, software, or real-world services using computer-readable and computer-understandable specifications to make them tradable on the web/Internet. It uses RDFS to provide a shared model. Check <a href="https://github.com/linked-usdl">Github</a> and <a href="http://www.linked-usdl.org">linked-usdl.org</a>

Bellow is an earlier video explaining the goal of USDL (please note that since then, XML has been replaced by RDFS).

### Service Systems

The Linked Service System model for the Unified Service Description Language (LSS-USDL) explores the development of lightweight semantic models to capture the essence of service systems. Real service systems can be modeled with LSS-USDL, they can be accessed and queried programmatically, and they can be annotated with background knowledge. Check <a href="https://github.com/jorge-cardoso/lss-usdl">Github</a> and this recent book <a href="http://www.springer.com/computer/database+management+%26+information+retrieval/book/978-3-319-10812-4">Service Systems</a>.

This approach provides descriptions that can be used for service management, optimization, and analytics.

### Service Networks

Societies are becoming increasingly service-oriented. Service revenues from companies, such as Rolls Royce, Caterpillar, and ThyssenKrupp, often reach more than 35\% of total sales. In the field of information technology, the global spending on cloud services is expected to grow 40\% over the next seven years. Despite these facts, services are still the least studied part of the economy.

The observation that the power of service-based economies is no longer restricted to individual organizations, but spans across networks, is the main driver for conducting service network research. Networks play an important role in many application areas such as energy grid distribution and smart city planning. Service networks are a class of networks of emerging interest since worldwide economies are becoming increasingly connected. Nonetheless, while the economies of many countries are becoming service-oriented, very few studies on service networks exist.

Understanding when, why, where, and how service networks function best is fundamental for the future because their analysis can provide an ``x-ray'' of service-based economies.
