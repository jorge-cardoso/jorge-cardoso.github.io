Reliability is a measure of the percentage uptime of cloud services to customers, considering the downtime due to faults. Many cloud providers are setting a reliability level of 99.95%. This means that if you provision a VM it will be available 99.95% of the time, with a possible downtime of 21.6 minutes per month. Reliability is an important characteristic which enables platforms to adapt and recover under stress and remain functional from a customer perspective. You can information additional information from a Meetup meeting on [Cloud Reliability and Resilience](http://www.slideshare.net/JorgeCardoso4/cloud-resilience-with-open-stack). 

Every year big companies made the headlines for the wrpng reason: reliability problems. In 2016, 



## OpenStack Cloud OS
OpenStack is a cloud operating system (Cloud OS) for building public and private clouds. It can control pools of compute, storage, and networking recourses located in large data centres. It is supported by major IT players in the world which include IBM, HP, Intel, Huawei, Red Hat, AT&T, and Ericsson. At Huawei Research we are currently developing the next generation of reliable cloud platforms for Deutsche Telekom. The Open Telekom Cloud engineered by Huawei and operated by T-Systems was launched at CeBIT 2016 and delivers flexible and convenient cloud services.
