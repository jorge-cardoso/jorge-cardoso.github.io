Cloud Reliability and Resilience
----------------------------------

## What is Cloud Reliability and Resilience?
Reliability is a measure of the percentage uptime of cloud services to customers, considering the downtime due to faults. Many cloud providers are setting a reliability level of 99.95%. This means that if you provision a VM it will be available 99.95% of the time, with a possible downtime of 21.6 minutes per month. Reliability is an important characteristic which enables platforms to adapt and recover under stress and remain functional from a customer perspective. You can find additional information from a Meetup meeting on [Cloud Reliability and Resilience](http://www.slideshare.net/JorgeCardoso4/cloud-resilience-with-open-stack). 

Every year big companies made the headlines for the wrong reason: reliability problems. In Q1 2016, Microsoft (9 days), Twitter (8h), Apple (7h), are PayPal (7h) are the "lucky" winners:

+ Two separate outages meant [Microsoft's biggest customers haven't had access to email](http://www.businessinsider.de/microsoft-has-a-9-day-long-office-365-outage-2016-1?r=UK&IR=T) for several days.
+ [Twitter Went Down](http://recode.net/2016/01/19/twitter-went-down-because-of-an-internal-code-change/) Because of an ‘Internal Code Change’.
+ eBay, Etsy and Online Merchants Hit by [PayPal Outage](http://www.ecommercebytes.com/C/blog/blog.pl?/pl/2016/3/1457113386.html)
+ [Apple Pay suffers](http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/2446737/apple-pay-suffers-first-wobble-with-seven-hour-outage) first wobble with seven-hour outage. Problem saw Visa users unable to sign up to iPhone payments service.

Cloud resiliency is the ability of a cloud platform or service to recover and continue operating when failures occur. Automated means for recovery are the most desirable solutions.

## OpenStack Cloud OS
OpenStack is a cloud operating system (Cloud OS) for building public and private clouds. It can control pools of compute, storage, and networking recourses located in large data centres. It is supported by major IT players in the world which include IBM, HP, Intel, Huawei, Red Hat, AT&T, and Ericsson. At Huawei Research we are currently developing the next generation of reliable cloud platforms for Deutsche Telekom. The Open Telekom Cloud engineered by Huawei and operated by T-Systems was launched at CeBIT 2016 and delivers flexible and convenient cloud services.

Major players are building competences in the field of cloud reliability. [Microsoft Trustworthy Computing](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/twc/reliability.aspx) has a division dedicated to Reliability and IBM offers specialized [Resiliency Services](http://www-935.ibm.com/services/us/en/it-services/business-continuity/) to assure continuous business operations and improve overall reliability.


## Available Approaches

+ [Fault-injection technologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fault_injection) or FIT provides approaches to demonstrate that software is robustness and fault tolerance by injecting faults to damage internal components to test its fault tolerance.

+ In [Experience report: Anomaly detection of cloud application operations using log and cloud metric correlation analysis (2015)](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7381796&url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fxpls%2Fabs_all.jsp%3Farnumber%3D7381796), the authors present an approach to detect anomalies by correlating data & events extracted from logs and metrics generated by Amazon AWS. While the approach is interesting, the level of detail provided by Amazon logging system does not enable to gain an insightful view and prediction of failures.
