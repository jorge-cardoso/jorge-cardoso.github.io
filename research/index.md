## PhD, MSc, and Visiting Positions

If you are curious about systems, want to be challenged and engage in cutting edge research, propose novel ideas not 
proposed before, and leave your own mark on the academic world, you are probably a good candidate for a PhD.

While a MSc involve often involves the application of existing models and techniques, a PhD are almost totally 
independent and involve the creation of novel knowledge not know before. 

If you would like to do you PhD or Msc with our applied research group visit the following 
webpage [Phd/MSsc and_visiting_positions](phd_msc_visiting_positions).

## AI-Driven Operations

Since 2016 my group is developing the [iForesight 3.0](iforesight) system which is being used to evaluate new O&M 
approaches. It is intelligent a new toolÂ aimed at [SRE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Site_Reliability_Engineering)
cloud maintenance teams. It enables them to quickly detect, localize and predict anomalies thanks to the use of
artificial intelligence when cloud services are slow or unresponsive.
