Projects
--------


| Project name | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| [Cloud AIOps](iforesight) | We are developing the [iForesight 3.0](iforesight) system which is being used to evaluate new O&M approaches for cloud platforms. It is intelligent a new tool aimed at [SRE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Site_Reliability_Engineering) cloud maintenance teams.  (2016-now) | 
| [Cloud Reliability](cloud_reliability) | We explored how [Chaos Engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_engineering), introduced by Netflix in 2011, can be used to improve the resiliency of complex distributed systems. (2015-2016) | 
| [Service Systems](service_systems) |  Service description languages (with the USDL family), service system modeling (with the LSS USDL language), service analytics (using process mining), and  service networks (using principals from social networks).  (2012-2015) | 
| [Past Projects](past_projects) | Over the years we have participated in many other projects...(before 2012) |


Open Positions
--------------

Thanks for your interest in working with our applied research group at the 
[Huawei Munich Research Center](https://huawei.eu/research-and-innovation) or at the 
[University of Coimbra](https://www.uc.pt/en). 

If you are curious about systems, want to be challenged and engage in cutting edge research, propose novel ideas not proposed before, and leave your own mark on the academic world, you are probably a good candidate for a PhD.
While a MSc involve often involves the application of existing models and techniques, a PhD are almost totally independent and involve the creation of novel knowledge not know before. 

Our group has a special in interested in the following fields:

+ AI applied to cloud operations (AIOps)
+ Planet-scale cloud computing.
+ Machine learning.
+ Distributed systems.
+ Other fields (see my [Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=n9JFmAkAAAAJ&hl=en)).

Our group thrives to see the larger picture, be innovative and creative, and drive to make a lasting impact 
on planet-scale distributed system design and software systems. *We can't solve problems by using the same kind of thinking we used when we created them* -- Einstein.

We are always looking forward to work with excellent researchers which:

+ Simplify the complexity of existing technical solutions (KISS principle) 
+ Solve difficult technical problems (DIY principle)
+ Focus on the solution, not the obstacle
+ Translate theory into practice
