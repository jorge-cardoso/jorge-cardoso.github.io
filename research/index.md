You would like to do research? Maybe your MSc or PhD? You love to discover new things? To propose new innovative ideas? You like the areas of Cloud Computing, Business Process Management, Information Systems, and Semantic Web?

Then you should  [send me an e-mail](mailto:jcardoso@dei.uc.pt) and we should have a chat (office D2.20). I always have a couple of interesting topics to be explored.

You can information additional information on my current research here:
