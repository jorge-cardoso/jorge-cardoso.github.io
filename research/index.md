Projects
--------


| Project name | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| [Cloud AIOps](iforesight) | We are developing the [iForesight 3.0](iforesight) system which is being used to evaluate new O&M approaches for cloud platforms. It is intelligent a new toolÂ aimed at [SRE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Site_Reliability_Engineering) cloud maintenance teams.  (2016-now) | 
| [Cloud Reliability](cloud_reliability) | We explored how [Chaos Engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_engineering), introduced by Netflix in 2011, can be used to improve the resiliency of complex distributed systems. (2015-2016) | 
| [Service Systems](service_systems) |  Service description languages (with the USDL family), service system modeling (with the LSS USDL language), service analytics (using process mining), and  service networks (using principals from social networks).  (2012-2015) | 
| [Past Projects](past_projects) | Over the years we have participated in many other projects...(before 2012) |


Open Positions
--------------

If you are curious about systems, want to be challenged and engage in cutting edge research, propose novel ideas not proposed before, and leave your own mark on the academic world, you are probably a good candidate for a PhD.
While a MSc involve often involves the application of existing models and techniques, a PhD are almost totally independent and involve the creation of novel knowledge not know before. 

If you would like to do you PhD or Msc with our applied research group visit the following webpage [Phd/MSsc and visiting positions](phd_msc_visiting_positions).

All the students that worked with us is available at [Past Students](students)
