Looking for a PhD/MSc topic?
-----------------
You would like to do research? Maybe your MSc or PhD? You love to discover new things? To propose new innovative ideas? You like the areas of Cloud Computing, Business Process Management, Information Systems, and Semantic Web?

+ [Writing a Thesis Proposal](http://sydney.edu.au/stuserv/documents/thesisproposal.pdf), Learning Centre, University of Sydney.
+ The Ten Commandments for writing academic papers, by Julienne Hanson, Bartlett School of Architecture, London, November, 1988.
+ How to write a great research paper, Simon Peyton Jones at Microsoft Research.

Then you should send me an e-mail (jcardoso hhatte dei.uc.pt) and/or we should have a chat (office D2.20). I always have a couple of interesting topics to be explored.

You can information additional information on my research here:

+ [Cloud Reliability and Resilience](http://www.slideshare.net/JorgeCardoso4/cloud-resilience-with-open-stack)  
+ [Service Systems](service_systems.md)

Information on past projects can be found here:
